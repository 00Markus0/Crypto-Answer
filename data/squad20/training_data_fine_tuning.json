          "context": "DOGE Price Live Data\nThe live Dogecoin price today is $0,275626 USD with a 24-hour trading volume of $2.693.741.066 USD. Dogecoin is down 3,51% in the last 24 hours. The current CoinMarketCap ranking is #7, with a live market cap of $36.113.186.395 USD. It has a circulating supply of 131.022.506.796 DOGE coins and the max. supply is not available.\n\nIf you would like to know where to buy Dogecoin, the top exchanges for trading in Dogecoin are currently Binance, OKEx, CoinTiger, FTX, and Huobi Global. You can find others listed on our crypto exchanges page.\n\nWhat Is Dogecoin?\nDogecoin (DOGE) is based on the popular \"doge\" Internet meme and features a Shiba Inu on its logo. The open-source digital currency was created by Billy Markus from Portland, Oregon and Jackson Palmer from Sydney, Australia, and was forked from Litecoin in December 2013. Dogecoin's creators envisaged it as a fun, light-hearted cryptocurrency that would have greater appeal beyond the core Bitcoin audience, since it was based on a dog meme. Tesla CEO Elon Musk posted several tweets on social media that Dogecoin is his favorite coin.\n\nHow Do You Mine Dogecoin?\nDogecoin differs from Bitcoin's proof-of-work protocol in several ways, one of which is by using Scrypt technology. The altcoin has also a block time of 1 minute, and the total supply is uncapped, which means that there is no limit to the number of Dogecoin that can be mined. You can mine Dogecoin either solo, or by joining a mining pool. A Doge miner can mine the digital currency on Windows, Mac or Linux, and with a GPU. As of 2014, you can also mine Litecoin in the same process of mining Dogecoin, as the processes were merged.\n\nWhat Can Dogecoin Be Used For?\nDogecoin has been used primarily as a tipping system on Reddit and Twitter to reward the creation or sharing of quality content. You can get tipped Dogecoin by participating in a community that uses the digital currency, or you can get your Dogecoin from a Dogecoin faucet. A Dogecoin faucet is a website that will give you a small amount of Dogecoin for free as an introduction to the currency, so that you can begin interacting in Dogecoin communities.\n\nHow Can You Buy Dogecoin?\nYou can sell or buy Dogecoin at any exchange that offers the digital currency, store it on an exchange or in a Dogecoin wallet, and tip Dogecoin in any communities that accept Dogecoin.

It has a circulating supply of 130 Billion DOGE coins and a total supply of ∞. If you are looking to buy or sell Dogecoin, Binance is currently the most active exchange.\n\nDogecoin is a cryptocurrency based on the popular \"Doge\" Internet meme and features a Shiba Inu on its logo. Dogecoin is a Litecoin fork. Introduced as a \"joke currency\" on 6 December 2013, Dogecoin quickly developed its own online community and reached a capitalization of US$60 million in January 2014. Compared with other cryptocurrencies, Dogecoin had a fast initial coin production schedule: 100 billion coins were in circulation by mid-2015, with an additional 5.256 billion coins every year thereafter. As of 30 June 2015, the 100 billionth Dogecoin had been mined.\n\nDogecoin was created by Billy Markus from Portland, Oregon and Jackson Palmer from Sydney, Australia. Both wanted to create a fun cryptocurrency that will appeal beyond the core Bitcoin audience. Dogecoin is primarily used as a tipping system on Reddit and Twitter where users tip each other for creating or sharing good content. The community is very active in organising fundraising activities for deserving causes.\n\nThe developers of Dogecoin haven’t made any major changes to the coin since 2015. This means that Dogecoin could get left behind and is why Shibas are leaving Dogecoin to join more advanced platforms like Ethereum. One of Dogecoin strengths is its relaxed and fun-loving community. However, this is also a weakness because other currencies are way more professional.\n\nTo purchase Dogecoin, it involves downloading a crypto wallet, setting up a crypto exchange account and then trading away for your desired crypto currency. Once we have set up an account with a DOGE currency exchange and deposited some funds, you are ready to start trading.\n\nDOGE Price and Market Stats\nDOGE Price\t$0.276978\nMarket Cap\t$36,127,305,006\nMarket Cap Dominance\t1.73%\nTrading Volume\t$2,266,890,113\nVolume / Market Cap\t0.0631\n24h Low / 24h High\t$0.272700 / $0.295172\n7d Low / 7d High\t$0.275374 / $0.331334\nMarket Cap Rank\t#7\nAll-Time High\t$0.731578 -62.5%\nMay 08, 2021 (4 months)\nAll-Time Low\t$0.00008690 315801.4%\nMay 06, 2015 (over 6 years)\n\n\n",

          "context": "USDT Price Live Data\nThe live Tether price today is $1,00 USD with a 24-hour trading volume of $82.879.317.542 USD. Tether is down ,00% in the last 24 hours. The current CoinMarketCap ranking is #5, with a live market cap of $65.536.280.196 USD. It has a circulating supply of 65.511.633.976 USDT coins and the max. supply is not available.\n\nIf you would like to know where to buy Tether, the top exchanges for trading in Tether are currently Binance, OKEx, CoinTiger, FTX, and Huobi Global. You can find others listed on our crypto exchanges page.\n\nWhat Is Tether (USDT)?\nUSDT is a stablecoin (stable-value cryptocurrency) that mirrors the price of the U.S. dollar, issued by a Hong Kong-based company Tether. The token’s peg to the USD is achieved via maintaining a sum of commercial paper, fiduciary deposits, cash, reserve repo notes, and treasury bills in reserves that is equal in USD value to the number of USDT in circulation.\n\nOriginally launched in July 2014 as Realcoin, a second-layer cryptocurrency token built on top of Bitcoin’s blockchain through the use of the Omni platform, it was later renamed to USTether, and then, finally, to USDT. In addition to Bitcoin’s, USDT was later updated to work on the Ethereum, EOS, Tron, Algorand, and OMG blockchains.\n\nThe stated purpose of USDT is to combine the unrestricted nature of cryptocurrencies — which can be sent between users without a trusted third-party intermediary — with the stable value of the US dollar.\n\nWho Are The Founders Of Tether?\nUSDT — or as it was known at the time, Realcoin — was launched in 2014 by Brock Pierce, Reeve Collins and Craig Sellars.\n\nBrock Pierce is a well-known entrepreneur who has co-founded a number of high-profile projects in the crypto and entertainment industries. In 2013, he co-founded a venture capital firm Blockchain Capital, which by 2017 had raised over $80 million in funding. In 2014, Pierce became the director of the Bitcoin Foundation, a nonprofit established to help improve and promote Bitcoin. Pierce has also co-founded Block.one, the company behind EOS, one of the largest cryptocurrencies on the market.\n\nReeve Collins was the CEO of Tether for the first two years of its existence. Prior to that, he had co-founded several successful companies, such as the online ad network Traffic Marketplace, entertainment studio RedLever and gambling website Pala Interactive. As of 2020, Collins is heading SmarMedia Technologies, a marketing and advertising tech company.\n\nOther than working on Tether, Craig Sellars has been a member of the Omni Foundation for over six years. Its Omni Protocol allows users to create and trade smart-contract based properties and currencies on top of Bitcoin’s blockchain. Sellars has also worked in several other cryptocurrency companies and organizations, such as Bitfinex, Factom, Synereo and the MaidSafe Foundation.\n\nWhat Makes Tether Unique?\nUSDT’s unique feature is the fact that its value is guaranteed by Tether to remain pegged to the U.S. dollar. According to Tether, whenever it issues new USDT tokens, it allocates the same amount of USD to its reserves, thus ensuring that USDT is fully backed by cash and cash equivalents.\n\nThe famously high volatility of the crypto markets means that cryptocurrencies can rise or fall by 10-20% within a single day, making them unreliable as a store of value. USDT, on the other hand, is protected from these fluctuations.\n\nThis property makes USDT a safe haven for crypto investors: during periods of high volatility, they can park their portfolios in Tether without having to completely cash out into USD. In addition, USDT provides a simple way to transact a U.S. dollar equivalent between regions, countries and even continents via blockchain — without having to rely on a slow and expensive intermediary, like a bank or a financial services provider.\n\nHowever, over the years, there have been a number of controversies regarding the validity of Tether’s claims about their USD reserves, at times disrupting USDT’s price, which went down as low as $0.88 at one point in its history. Many have raised concerns about the fact that Tether’s reserves have never been fully audited by an independent third party.\n\nRelated Pages:\nLooking for market and blockchain data for BTC?

Use CoinMarketCap’s guide.\n\nHow Many Tether (USDT) Coins Are There In Circulation?\nThere is no hard-coded limit on the total supply of USDT — given the fact that it belongs to a private company, theoretically, its issuance is limited only by Tether’s own policies. However, because Tether claims that every single USDT is supposed to be backed by one U.S. dollar, the amount of tokens is limited by the company’s actual cash reserves.\n\nMoreover, Tether does not disclose its issuance schedules ahead of time. Instead, they provide daily transparency reports, listing the total amount of their asset reserves and liabilities, the latter corresponding to the amount of USDT in circulation.\n\nAs of September 2020, there are over 14.4 billion USDT tokens in circulation, which are backed by $14.6 billion in assets, according to Tether.\n\nHow Is the Tether Network Secured?\nUSDT does not have its own blockchain — instead, it operates as a second-layer token on top of other cryptocurrencies’ blockchains: Bitcoin, Ethereum, EOS, Tron, Algorand, Bitcoin Cash and OMG, and is secured by their respective hashing algorithms.\n\nWhere Can You Buy Tether (USDT)?\nIt is possible to buy Tether / USDT on a large number of cryptocurrency exchanges. In fact, USDT’s average daily trading volume is often on par or even exceeds that of Bitcoin. It is especially prominent on those exchanges where fiat-to-crypto trading pairs are unavailable, as it provides a viable alternative to USD. Here are some of the most popular exchanges that support Tether trading:\n\nBinance\nOKEx\nHitBTC\nHuobi Global",

The primary advantage is the lack of central authority. When a ledger update happens, each node constructs the new transaction, and then the nodes vote by consensus algorithm on which copy is correct. Once a consensus has been determined, all the other nodes update themselves with the new, correct copy of the ledger.[4][5] Security is accomplished through cryptographic keys and signatures.[6][7][8]\n\nApplications\nIn 2016, some banks tested distributed ledgers for payments[9] to see if investing in distributed ledgers is supported by their usefulness.[2]\n\nTypes\nDistributed ledgers may be permissioned or permissionless. This determines if anyone or only approved people can run a node to validate transactions.[10] They also vary between the consensus algorithm – proof of work, proof of stake, voting systems and hashgraph. They may be mineable (one can claim ownership of new coins contributing with a node) or not (the creator of the cryptocurrency owns all at the beginning).\n\nAll blockchain is considered to be a form of DLT. There are also non-blockchain distributed ledger tables.\n\nNon-blockchain DLTs can be in the form of a distributed cryptocurrency or they may be the architecture on which private or public data is stored or shared.\n\nThe main difference is that while blockchain requires global consensus across all nodes a DLT can achieve consensus without having to validate across the entire blockchain.[clarification needed]",

          "context": "BTC Price Live Data\nThe live Bitcoin price today is $46.878,91 USD with a 24-hour trading volume of $35.830.267.301 USD. Bitcoin is down 2,11% in the last 24 hours. The current CoinMarketCap ranking is #1, with a live market cap of $881.222.661.156 USD. It has a circulating supply of 18.797.850 BTC coins and a max. supply of 21.000.000 BTC coins.\n\nIf you would like to know where to buy Bitcoin, the top exchanges for trading in Bitcoin are currently Binance, OKEx, CoinTiger, FTX, and Huobi Global. You can find others listed on our crypto exchanges page.\n\nWhat Is Bitcoin (BTC)?\nBitcoin is a decentralized cryptocurrency originally described in a 2008 whitepaper by a person, or group of people, using the alias Satoshi Nakamoto. It was launched soon after, in January 2009.\n\nBitcoin is a peer-to-peer online currency, meaning that all transactions happen directly between equal, independent network participants, without the need for any intermediary to permit or facilitate them. Bitcoin was created, according to Nakamoto’s own words, to allow “online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.”\n\nSome concepts for a similar type of a decentralized electronic currency precede BTC, but Bitcoin holds the distinction of being the first-ever cryptocurrency to come into actual use.\n\nWho Are the Founders of Bitcoin?\nBitcoin’s original inventor is known under a pseudonym, Satoshi Nakamoto. As of 2020, the true identity of the person — or organization — that is behind the alias remains unknown.\n\nOn October 31, 2008, Nakamoto published Bitcoin’s whitepaper, which described in detail how a peer-to-peer, online currency could be implemented. They proposed to use a decentralized ledger of transactions packaged in batches (called “blocks”) and secured by cryptographic algorithms — the whole system would later be dubbed “blockchain.”\n\nJust two months later, on January 3, 2009, Nakamoto mined the first block on the Bitcoin network, known as the genesis block, thus launching the world’s first cryptocurrency.\n\nHowever, while Nakamoto was the original inventor of Bitcoin, as well as the author of its very first implementation, over the years a large number of people have contributed to improving the cryptocurrency’s software by patching vulnerabilities and adding new features.\n\nBitcoin’s source code repository on GitHub lists more than 750 contributors, with some of the key ones being Wladimir J. van der Laan, Marco Falke, Pieter Wuille, Gavin Andresen, Jonas Schnelli and others.\n\nWhat Makes Bitcoin Unique?\nBitcoin’s most unique advantage comes from the fact that it was the very first cryptocurrency to appear on the market.\n\nIt has managed to create a global community and give birth to an entirely new industry of millions of enthusiasts who create, invest in, trade and use Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in their everyday lives. The emergence of the first cryptocurrency has created a conceptual and technological basis that subsequently inspired the development of thousands of competing projects.\n\nThe entire cryptocurrency market — now worth more than $300 billion — is based on the idea realized by Bitcoin: money that can be sent and received by anyone, anywhere in the world without reliance on trusted intermediaries, such as banks and financial services companies.\n\nThanks to its pioneering nature, BTC remains at the top of this energetic market after over a decade of existence. Even after Bitcoin has lost its undisputed dominance, it remains the largest cryptocurrency, with a market capitalization that fluctuated between $100-$200 billion in 2020, owing in large part to the ubiquitousness of platforms that provide use-cases for BTC: wallets, exchanges, payment services, online games and more.\n\nRelated Pages:\nLooking for market and blockchain data for BTC?

New coins are created during the process known as “mining”: as transactions are relayed across the network, they get picked up by miners and packaged into blocks, which are in turn protected by complex cryptographic calculations.\n\nAs compensation for spending their computational resources, the miners receive rewards for every block that they successfully add to the blockchain. At the moment of Bitcoin’s launch, the reward was 50 bitcoins per block: this number gets halved with every 210,000 new blocks mined — which takes the network roughly four years. As of 2020, the block reward has been halved three times and comprises 6.25 bitcoins.\n\nBitcoin has not been premined, meaning that no coins have been mined and/or distributed between the founders before it became available to the public. However, during the first few years of BTC’s existence, the competition between miners was relatively low, allowing the earliest network participants to accumulate significant amounts of coins via regular mining: Satoshi Nakamoto alone is believed to own over a million Bitcoin.\n\nMining Bitcoins can be very profitable for miners, depending on the current hash rate and the price of Bitcoin. While the process of mining Bitcoins is complex, we discuss how long it takes to mine one Bitcoin on CMC Alexandria — as we wrote above, mining Bitcoin is best understood as how long it takes to mine one block, as opposed to one Bitcoin.\n\nHow Is the Bitcoin Network Secured?\nBitcoin is secured with the SHA-256 algorithm, which belongs to the SHA-2 family of hashing algorithms, which is also used by its fork Bitcoin Cash (BCH), as well as several other cryptocurrencies.\n\nWhat Is Bitcoin’s Role as a Store of Value?\nBitcoin is the first decentralized, peer-to-peer digital currency. One of its most important functions is that it is used as a decentralized store of value. In other words, it provides for ownership rights as a physical asset or as a unit of account. However, the latter store-of-value function has been debated. Many crypto enthusiasts and economists believe that high-scale adoption of the top currency will lead us to a new modern financial world where transaction amounts will be denominated in smaller units.\n\nThe top crypto is considered a store of value, like gold, for many — rather than a currency. This idea of the first cryptocurrency as a store of value, instead of a payment method, means that many people buy the crypto and hold onto it long-term (or HODL) rather than spending it on items like you would typically spend a dollar — treating it as digital gold.\n\nCrypto Wallets\nThe most popular wallets for cryptocurrency include both hot and cold wallets. Cryptocurrency wallets vary from hot wallets and cold wallets. Hot wallets are able to be connected to the web, while cold wallets are used for keeping large amounts of coins outside of the internet.\n\nSome of the top crypto cold wallets are Trezor, Ledger and CoolBitX. Some of the top crypto hot wallets include Exodus, Electrum and Mycelium.\n\nHow Is Bitcoin’s Technology Upgraded?\nA hard fork is a radical change to the protocol that makes previously invalid blocks/transactions valid, and therefore requires all users to upgrade. For example, if users A and B are disagreeing on whether an incoming transaction is valid, a hard fork could make the transaction valid to users A and B, but not to user C.\n\nA hard fork is a protocol upgrade that is not backward compatible. This means every node (computer connected to the Bitcoin network using a client that performs the task of validating and relaying transactions) needs to upgrade before the new blockchain with the hard fork activates and rejects any blocks or transactions from the old blockchain. The old blockchain will continue to exist and will continue to accept transactions, although it may be incompatible with other newer Bitcoin clients.\n\nA soft fork is a change to the Bitcoin protocol wherein only previously valid blocks/transactions are made invalid. Since old nodes will recognise the new blocks as valid, a soft fork is backward-compatible. This kind of fork requires only a majority of the miners upgrading to enforce the new rules.\n\nSome examples of prominent cryptocurrencies that have undergone hard forks are the following: Bitcoin’s hard fork that resulted in Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum’s hard fork that resulted in Ethereum Classic.\n\nhttps://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/bitcoin-vs-bitcoin-cash-vs-bitcoin-svBitcoin Cash has been hard forked since its original forking, with the creation of Bitcoin SV.\n\nWhat Is the Lightning Network?\nThe Lightning Network is an off-chain, layered payment protocol that operates bidirectional payment channels which allows instantaneous transfer with instant reconciliation. It enables private, high volume and trustless transactions between any two parties. The Lightning Network scales transaction capacity without incurring the costs associated with transactions and interventions on the underlying blockchain.\n\nHow Much Is Bitcoin?\nThe current valuation of Bitcoin is constantly moving, all day every day. It is a truly global asset. From a start of under one cent per coin, BTC has risen in price by thousands of percent to the numbers you see above. The prices of all cryptocurrencies are quite volatile, meaning that anyone’s understanding of how much is Bitcoin will change by the minute. However, there are times when different countries and exchanges show different prices and understanding how much is Bitcoin will be a function of a person’s location.\n\nWhere Can You Buy Bitcoin (BTC)?\nBitcoin is, in many regards, almost synonymous with cryptocurrency, which means that you can buy Bitcoin on virtually every crypto exchange — both for fiat money and other cryptocurrencies. Some of the main markets where BTC trading is available are:\n\nBinance\nCoinbase Pro\nOKEx\nKraken\nHuobi Global\nBitfinex\nIf you are new to crypto, use CoinMarketCap’s own easy guide to buying Bitcoin.\n\nOur most recent articles about Bitcoin:\n\nEthereum Dreams To Flip Bitcoin – Can It Happen?\nBitcoin Crosses $50K: The Start of Another Bull Run?\nBlockchain in Space: What’s Going on 4 Years After the First Bitcoin Transaction in Orbit?\nSteady Crypto Market: Weekly Market Review From TokenInsight\nCrypto Auctions in the US — How to Buy Bitcoin at Lower Rates",

          "context": "ETH Price Live Data\nThe live Ethereum price today is $3.091,83 USD with a 24-hour trading volume of $19.603.720.388 USD. Ethereum is down 2,40% in the last 24 hours. The current CoinMarketCap ranking is #2, with a live market cap of $362.551.919.608 USD. It has a circulating supply of 117.261.352 ETH coins and the max. supply is not available.\n\nIf you would like to know where to buy Ethereum, the top exchanges for trading in Ethereum are currently Binance, OKEx, CoinTiger, FTX, and Huobi Global. You can find others listed on our crypto exchanges page.\n\nWhat Is Ethereum (ETH)?\nEthereum is a decentralized open-source blockchain system that features its own cryptocurrency, Ether. ETH works as a platform for numerous other cryptocurrencies, as well as for the execution of decentralized smart contracts.\n\nEthereum was first described in a 2013 whitepaper by Vitalik Buterin. Buterin, along with other co-founders, secured funding for the project in an online public crowd sale in the summer of 2014 and officially launched the blockchain on July 30, 2015.\n\nEthereum’s own purported goal is to become a global platform for decentralized applications, allowing users from all over the world to write and run software that is resistant to censorship, downtime and fraud.\n\nWho Are the Founders of Ethereum?\nEthereum has a total of eight co-founders — an unusually large number for a crypto project. They first met on June 7, 2014, in Zug, Switzerland.\n\nRussian-Canadian Vitalik Buterin is perhaps the best known of the bunch. He authored the original white paper that first described Ethereum in 2013 and still works on improving the platform to this day. Prior to ETH, Buterin co-founded and wrote for the Bitcoin Magazine news website.\n\nBritish programmer Gavin Wood is arguably the second most important co-founder of ETH, as he coded the first technical implementation of Ethereum in the C++ programming language, proposed Ethereum’s native programming language Solidity and was the first chief technology officer of the Ethereum Foundation. Before Ethereum, Wood was a research scientist at Microsoft. Afterward, he moved on to establish the Web3 Foundation.\n\nAmong the other co-founders of Ethereum are: - Anthony Di Iorio, who underwrote the project during its early stage of development. - Charles Hoskinson, who played the principal role in establishing the Swiss-based Ethereum Foundation and its legal framework. - Mihai Alisie, who provided assistance in establishing the Ethereum Foundation. - Joseph Lubin, a Canadian entrepreneur, who, like Di Iorio, has helped fund Ethereum during its early days, and later founded an incubator for startups based on ETH called ConsenSys. - Amir Chetrit, who helped co-found Ethereum but stepped away from it early into the development.\n\nWhat Makes Ethereum Unique?\nEthereum has pioneered the concept of a blockchain smart contract platform. Smart contracts are computer programs that automatically execute the actions necessary to fulfill an agreement between several parties on the internet. They were designed to reduce the need for trusted intermediates between contractors, thus reducing transaction costs while also increasing transaction reliability.\n\nEthereum’s principal innovation was designing a platform that allowed it to execute smart contracts using the blockchain, which further reinforces the already existing benefits of smart contract technology. Ethereum’s blockchain was designed, according to co-founder Gavin Wood, as a sort of “one computer for the entire planet,” theoretically able to make any program more robust, censorship-resistant and less prone to fraud by running it on a globally distributed network of public nodes.\n\nIn addition to smart contracts, Ethereum’s blockchain is able to host other cryptocurrencies, called “tokens,” through the use of its ERC-20 compatibility standard. In fact, this has been the most common use for the ETH platform so far: to date, more than 280,000 ERC-20-compliant tokens have been launched. Over 40 of these make the top-100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, for example, USDT, LINK and BNB.\n\nRelated Pages:\nNew to crypto? Learn how to buy Bitcoin today.\n\nReady to learn more?

Read our blog!\n\nHow Many Ethereum (ETH) Coins Are There In Circulation?\nIn August 2020, there were around 112 million ETH coins in circulation, 72 million of which were issued in the genesis block — the first ever block on the Ethereum blockchain. Of these 72 million, 60 million were allocated to the initial contributors to the 2014 crowd sale that funded the project, and 12 million were given to the development fund.\n\nThe remaining amount has been issued in the form of block rewards to the miners on the Ethereum network. The original reward in 2015 was 5 ETH per block, which later went down to 3 ETH in late 2017 and then to 2 ETH in early 2019. The average time it takes to mine an Ethereum block is around 13-15 seconds.\n\nOne of the major differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum’s economics is that the latter is not deflationary, i.e. its total supply is not limited. Ethereum’s developers justify this by not wanting to have a “fixed security budget” for the network. Being able to adjust ETH’s issuance rate via consensus allows the network to maintain the minimum issuance needed for adequate security.\n\nHow Is the Ethereum Network Secured?\nAs of August 2020, Ethereum is secured via the Ethash proof-of-work algorithm, belonging to the Keccak family of hash functions.\n\nThere are plans, however, to transition the network to a proof-of-stake algorithm tied to the major Ethereum 2.0 update, which launched in late 2020.\n\nAfter the Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain (Phase 0) went live in the beginning of December 2020, it became possible to begin staking on the Ethereum 2.0 network. An Ethereum stake is when you deposit ETH (acting as a validator) on Ethereum 2.0 by sending it to a deposit contract, basically acting as a miner and thus securing the network. At the time of writing in mid-December 2020, the Ethereum stake price, or the amount of money earned daily by Ethereum validators, is about 0.00403 ETH a day, or $2.36. This number will change as the network develops and the amount of stakers (validators) increase.\n\nEthereum staking rewards are determined by a distribution curve (the participation and average percent of stakers): some ETH 2.0 staking rewards are at 20% for early stakers, but will be lowered to end up between 7% and 4.5% annually.\n\nThe minimum requirements for an Ethereum stake are 32 ETH. If you decide to stake in Ethereum 2.0, it means that your Ethererum stake will be locked up on the network for months, if not years, in the future until the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade is completed.\n\nWhere Can You Buy Ethereum (ETH)?\nGiven the fact that Ethereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin, it is possible to buy Ethereum, or use ETH trading pairs on nearly all of the major crypto exchanges. Some of the largest markets include:\n\nBinance\nCoinbase Pro\nOKEx\nKraken\nHuobi Global",

          "context": "Bitcoin Price & Market Data\nBitcoin price today is $46,850.41 with a 24-hour trading volume of $36,284,485,303. BTC price is down -1.8% in the last 24 hours. It has a circulating supply of 19 Million BTC coins and a total supply of 21 Million. If you are looking to buy or sell Bitcoin, Bitfinex is currently the most active exchange.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin?\nBitcoin is a cryptocurrency. It is a decentralized digital currency that is based on cryptography. As such, it can operate without the need of a central authority like a central bank or a company. It is unlike government-issued or fiat currencies such as US Dollars or Euro in which they are controlled by the country’s central bank. The decentralized nature allows it to operate on a peer-to-peer network whereby users are able to send funds to each other without going through intermediaries.\n\n\n\nFor more information on Bitcoin, do read CoinGecko's How to Bitcoin book.\n\nWho created Bitcoin?\nThe creator is an unknown individual or group that goes by the name Satoshi Nakamoto with the idea of an electronic peer-to-peer cash system as it is written in a whitepaper. Until today, the true identity of Satoshi Nakamoto has not been verified though there has been speculation and rumor as to who Satoshi might be.\n\nbitcoin-phases-of-money\n\nWhen was Bitcoin launched?\nIt was launched in January 2009 with the first genesis block mined on 9th January 2009.\n\nHow does Bitcoin work?\nbitcoin-proof-of-work\n\nWhile the general public perceives Bitcoin as some kind of physical looking coin, it is actually far from that. Under the hood, it is actually a distributed accounting ledger that is stored in a form of a chain of blocks, hence the name blockchain.\n\nIn a centralized system like the ones operated by a commercial bank, given a situation where Alice wants to transact with Bob, the bank is the only entity that holds the ledger that describes how much balance Alice and Bob has. As the bank maintains the ledger, they will do the verification as to whether Alice has enough funds to send to Bob. Finally when the transaction successfully takes place, the Bank will deduct Alice’s account and credit Bob’s account with the latest amount.\n\nBitcoin conversely works in a decentralized manner. Since there is no central figure like a bank to verify the transactions and maintain the ledger, a copy of the ledger is distributed across Bitcoin nodes. A node is a piece of software that anybody can download and run to participate in the network. With that, everybody has a copy of how much balance Alice and Bob has, and there will be no dispute of fund balance.\n\nNow, if Alice were to transact with Bob using bitcoin. Alice will have to broadcast her transaction to the network that she intends to send $1 to Bob in equivalent amount of bitcoin. How would the system be able to determine that she has enough bitcoin to execute the transaction and also to ensure she does not double spend that same amount.\n\nHere is where mining takes place. A Bitcoin miner will use his or her computer rigs to validate Alice’s transaction to be added into the ledger. In order to stop a miner from adding any arbitrary transactions, they will need to solve a complex puzzle. Only if the miner is able to solve the puzzle (called the Proof of Work), which happens at random, then he or she is able to add the transactions into the ledger and the record is final.\n\nSince running these computer rigs cost money due to capital expenditure for buying the rigs and the cost of electricity, miners are rewarded with new supply of bitcoins that is part of its monetary system and some amount of fees paid by the person who wishes to transact (in this case it is Alice).\n\nThis makes the Bitcoin ledger resilient against fraud in a trustless manner. While it is resilient, there are still some risks associated with the system such as the 51% attack where by miners control more than 51% of the total computation power and also there can be security risks outside of the control of the Bitcoin protocol.\n\nHow to keep your Bitcoin safe?\nWhen transacting coins, you would typically be doing it on your personal computer. Since your personal computer is connected to the internet, it has the potential to be infected by malware or spywares which could compromise your funds. \n\nHardware wallets such as Trezor and Ledger are strongly encouraged in mitigating that risk. These are external devices that look like USB sticks. A hardware wallet secures your private key that holds your Bitcoin into an external device outside of your personal computer. When you intend to transact, you would connect the hardware wallet into your personal computer, and all the key signing in order to transact would be done in the hardware itself outside of your computer.\n\nHowever, if you physically lose your hardware wallet without a key phrase backup, there is no other way of recovering your funds ever. As such when setting up your hardware wallet, always remember to keep a copy of the key phrase and put it somewhere safe from fire or flood.\n\nBitcoin Halving\nBitcoin Halving or sometimes also known as the Halvening, refers to the reduction of block reward to miners by half. This is part of its built-in monetary policy, in which after every approximately 4 years, the mining reward will be halved towards the limited capped supply of 21 million Bitcoin. Once 21 million of Bitcoin have been minted, there will no longer be new supply of it rewarded to miners, and miners are expected to earn revenue by way of transaction fees.\n\nIn order to follow the real time of when the halving will take place, you can bookmark the CoinGecko's bitcoin halving page.\n\nThis is seen as a significant event for couple of reasons. Firstly, traders may speculate on the possible scarcity of Bitcoin making way to high volatility. Secondly, as miners' rewards will be reduced, we may see some miners exiting the market as they could not sustain the lower profitability. This in turn may cause the hashing rate to reduce and mining pools may consolidate. Due to this, the bitcoin network may be a little unstable during the halving period.\n\nIs Bitcoin a good investment?\nWe do not provide investment advice. The price of bitcoin started off as zero and made its way to the market price you see today. It appears that the market is placing value for the following reasons.\n\nDigital Gold - It is a viable digital store of value due to its digital scarcity\nPayment - Almost instant and low cost transaction with anyone on the internet\nSpeculation - This may be due to inefficiency in the market, but there are people speculating that Bitcoin may be the asset class of the future\nThat being said, Bitcoin comes with risks. In order to determine for yourself if it is a good investment, it is important to understand the risk and only invest amount that you are comfortable losing.\n\nThere is a probability of Bitcoin price going to zero. This can happen if the project fails, a critical software bug is found, or there are newer more innovative digital currencies that would take over its place. If you recall Bitcoin was worth nearly $20,000 in 16th December 2017. But in 17th December 2018, the price of Bitcoin was at its low of about $3,200. Bitcoin is a highly volatile asset class and requires a high risk appetite.\n\nAs much as Bitcoin is a digital gold, it has only been around for about 10 years. In comparison to gold which has been a widely known store of value for over hundreds of years.\n\nCan I short Bitcoin?\nYes, as bitcoin has grown to become more widely adopted, there are various derivative products being launched that allows you to short sell bitcoin. If you are an institutional investor, CME and Bakkt provide regulated bitcoin futures products which you can participate to long or short bitcoin. Alternatively, there are many other cryptocurrency derivative exchanges such as BitMEX, Binance Futures, FTX, Deribit, and more. These derivative exchanges are not formally regulated and can provide even up to 100x leverage. Derivative contracts are high risk products, you might want to understand what you are doing before participating in it.",

In 2001, Zhao joined Bloomberg as head of tradebook futures development. He spent four years with the company and later joined Fusion Systems as a partner.\n\nSince 2013, Changpeng Zhao has been actively involved with blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. He became head of development at Blockchain, and in 2015 he founded BijieTech. In 2017, Zhao officially launched Binance, and he has been the CEO of the company ever since.\n\nHe Yi is a co-founder and chief marketing officer at Binance. She started her career as a TV anchor and presenter on China Travel TV in 2012. Later, in 2014, Yi co-founded OKCoin, which was the largest fiat-to-crypto exchange in China at the time. In 2017, she joined forces with Changpeng Zhao, and together they created the largest crypto exchange globally — Binance.\n\nWhat Makes Binance Coin Unique?\nBinance is a unique ecosystem of decentralized, blockchain-based networks. The company has grown to be the leading crypto exchange in a number of countries, and their side organizations are attracting significant interest as well.\n\nOne of the biggest competitive advantages Binance has is its drive for development. While the company started only as a crypto exchange back in 2017, today, Binance has spread its services among numerous different spheres. According to the company website, its mission is to become the infrastructure services provider for the entire blockchain ecosystem.\n\nSince launching the Binance Coin, the exchange has also benefited from increased investor interest in the token. BNB went through a significant price increase at the beginning of 2021, which has put it on the map of enterprise investors.\n\nRelated Pages:\nRead more about Elrond.\n\nFind out more about bZx protocol.\n\nLearn more about DApps.\n\nBinance is launching an NFT marketplace.\n\nWhat are crypto debit cards?\n\nHow Many Binance Coin (BNB) Coins Are There in Circulation?\nThere is a maximum supply of 170,532,785 BNB coins, of which 153,432,897 are currently in circulation as of April 2021.\n\nAccording to the Binance whitepaper, exactly half of the maximum supply of BNB tokens was allocated towards the initial coin offering (ICO) and public sale of the token. Another 40% of the total supply, or around 80,000,000 BNB coins, was distributed among the founding members and team. Finally, the remaining 10% of the maximum supply was split among angel investors.\n\nHow Is the Binance Coin Network Secured?\nInitially, the Binance coin started as a traditional ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain. Later on, the company introduced its own blockchain, and the coins started being issued from the Binance blockchain, secured by the Tendermint byzantine-fault-tolerant (BFT) consensus mechanism.\n\nWhile ERC-20 tokens rely on the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus, which allows them to be extremely scalable, and allows for the creation of smart contracts. Unlike PoS, the Binance blockchain does not support smart contract functionalities. In contrast, the Bitcoin blockchain is secured by the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus, which is far more limited and consumes large amounts of electrical and computing power.\n\nWhere Can You Buy Binance Coin (BNB)?\nAs the dedicated utility token of the Binance exchange, the most straightforward way to acquire BNB coins would be to purchase them through Binance. The original exchange supports the largest variety of trading pairs with BNB, and it also has the best trading rates for the coin.\n\nIf you are looking for alternative exchanges where you can purchase BNB, FTX is a good choice. Keep in mind that investing in cryptocurrency can be risky, just like investing in any other type of asset.\n\nFind more information here about buying cryptos.",

          "context": "ADA Price Live Data\nThe live Cardano price today is $2,59 USD with a 24-hour trading volume of $7.221.727.893 USD. Cardano is down 2,28% in the last 24 hours. The current CoinMarketCap ranking is #3, with a live market cap of $83.136.880.020 USD. It has a circulating supply of 32.143.017.501 ADA coins and a max. supply of 45.000.000.000 ADA coins.\n\nIf you would like to know where to buy Cardano, the top exchanges for trading in Cardano are currently Binance, OKEx, CoinTiger, FTX, and Huobi Global. You can find others listed on our crypto exchanges page.\n\nWhat Is Cardano (ADA)?\nCardano is a proof-of-stake blockchain platform that says its goal is to allow “changemakers, innovators and visionaries” to bring about positive global change.\n\nTo learn more about this project, check out our deep dive of Cardano.\n\nThe open-source project also aims to “redistribute power from unaccountable structures to the margins to individuals” — helping to create a society that is more secure, transparent and fair.\n\nCardano was founded back in 2017, and the ADA token is designed to ensure that owners can participate in the operation of the network. Because of this, those who hold the cryptocurrency have the right to vote on any proposed changes to the software.\n\nThe team behind the layered blockchain say that there have already been some compelling use cases for its technology, which aims to allow decentralized apps and smart contracts to be developed with modularity.\n\nCardano is used by agricultural companies to track fresh produce from field to fork, while other products built on the platform allow educational credentials to be stored in a tamper-proof way, and retailers to clamp down on counterfeit goods.\n\nWho Are the Founders of Cardano?\nCardano was founded by Charles Hoskinson, who was also one of the co-founders of the Ethereum network. He is the CEO of IOHK, the company that built Cardano’s blockchain.\n\nIn an interview for CoinMarketCap’s Crypto Titans series, Hoskinson said that he got involved in cryptocurrencies back in 2011 — and dabbled in mining and trading. He explained that his first professional involvement in the industry came in 2013, when he created a course about Bitcoin that ended up being taken by 80,000 students.\n\nAs well as being a technology entrepreneur, Hoskinson is also a mathematician. In 2020, his technology company donated ADA worth $500,000 to the University of Wyoming’s Blockchain Research and Development Lab.\n\nWhat Makes Cardano Unique?\nCardano is one of the biggest blockchains to successfully use a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, which is less energy intensive than the proof-of-work algorithm relied upon by Bitcoin. Although the much larger Ethereum is going to be upgrading to PoS, this transition is only going to take place gradually.\n\nThe project has taken pride in ensuring that all of the technology developed goes through a process of peer-reviewed research, meaning that bold ideas can be challenged before they are validated. According to the Cardano team, this academic rigor helps the blockchain to be durable and stable — increasing the chance that potential pitfalls can be anticipated in advance.\n\nIn 2020, Cardano held a Shelley upgrade that aimed to make its blockchain “50 to 100 times more decentralized” than other large blockchains. At the time, Hoskinson predicted that this would pave the way for hundreds of assets to run on its network.\n\nRelated Pages:\n\nRead our interview with Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson\n\nA deep dive into the technology behind Ethereum 2.0\n\nBrush up on complicated crypto terms with our glossary\n\nCheck out our other interviews with crypto heavyweights\n\nA Deep Dive Into Cardano\n\nRead our crypto staking guide\n\nHow Many Cardano (ADA) Coins Are There in Circulation?\nThere is a maximum supply of 45 billion ADA — but at the time of writing, there was a circulating supply of about 31 billion. Five rounds of public sales of Cardano tokens were held between September 2015 and January 2017.\n\nApproximately 2.5 billion ADA was allotted to IOHK once the network launched. Meanwhile, an additional 2.1 billion ADA was given to Emurgo, a global blockchain technology company that served as a founding entity of the Cardano protocol. Last but not least, 648 million ADA was given to the not-for-profit Cardano Foundation, which aims to promote the platform and increase levels of adoption.\n\nOverall, about 16% of ADA’s total supply went to the project’s founders, with the remaining 84% being split among investors.\n\nHow Is the Cardano Network Secured?\nCardano is secured through an “environmentally sustainable, verifiably secure” PoS protocol that’s known as Ouroboros.\n\nThe project says that Ouroboros improves upon the security guarantees that are delivered by a PoW consensus mechanism while using substantially less power — claiming that it is four times more energy efficient than Bitcoin.\n\nIt is described as a blend of unique technology and mathematically verified mechanisms, with behavioral psychology and economic philosophy thrown in for good measure. Overall, the objective of Ouroboros is to achieve sustainable and ethical growth.\n\nAn incentive mechanism means that participants in the network are rewarded for their involvement.\n\nWhere Can You Buy Cardano (ADA)?\nAs one of the biggest cryptocurrencies in the world in terms of market capitalization, you shouldn’t have much difficulty in finding a major exchange to buy Cardano on including Binance, Bittrex, eToro, and HitBTC.\n\nIf you’re struggling to find a trading pair that unites ADA with your local currency, check out this guide on how to convert fiat into Bitcoin — giving you a gateway to buying altcoins.\"",

          "context": "LTC Price Live Data\nThe live Litecoin price today is $170,19 USD with a 24-hour trading volume of $1.819.697.168 USD. Litecoin is down 1,17% in the last 24 hours. The current CoinMarketCap ranking is #14, with a live market cap of $11.360.380.146 USD. It has a circulating supply of 66.752.615 LTC coins and a max. supply of 84.000.000 LTC coins.\n\nIf you would like to know where to buy Litecoin, the top exchanges for trading in Litecoin are currently Binance, OKEx, CoinTiger, FTX, and Huobi Global. You can find others listed on our crypto exchanges page.\n\nWhat Is Litecoin (LTC)?\nLitecoin (LTC) is a cryptocurrency that was designed to provide fast, secure and low-cost payments by leveraging the unique properties of blockchain technology.\n\nTo learn more about this project, check out our deep dive of Litecoin.\n\nThe cryptocurrency was created based on the Bitcoin (BTC) protocol, but it differs in terms of the hashing algorithm used, hard cap, block transaction times and a few other factors. Litecoin has a block time of just 2.5 minutes and extremely low transaction fees, making it suitable for micro-transactions and point-of-sale payments.\n\nLitecoin was released via an open-source client on GitHub on Oct. 7, 2011, and the Litecoin Network went live five days later on Oct. 13, 2011. Since then, it has exploded in both usage and acceptance among merchants and has counted among the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization for most of its existence.\n\nThe cryptocurrency was created by Charlie Lee, a former Google employee, who intended Litecoin to be a \"lite version of Bitcoin,\" in that it features many of the same properties as Bitcoin—albeit lighter in weight.\n\nWho Are the Founders of Litecoin?\nAs we previously touched on, Litecoin was founded by Charlie Lee, an early cryptocurrency adopter and a name held in high regard in the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nCharlie Lee, also known as “Chocobo,” is an early Bitcoin miner and computer scientist, who was a former software engineer for Google. In addition, Charlie Lee held the role of director of engineering at Coinbase between 2015 and 2017 before moving on to other ventures.\n\n\\ Today, Charlie Lee is an outspoken advocate of cryptocurrencies and is the managing director of the Litecoin Foundation—a non-profit organization that works alongside the Litecoin Core Development team to help advance Litecoin.\n\nBesides Lee, the Litecoin Foundation also includes three other individuals on the board of directors: Xinxi Wang, Alan Austin and Zing Yang — all of which are accomplished in their own right.\n\nWhat Makes Litecoin Unique?\nBehind Bitcoin, Litecoin is the second most popular pure cryptocurrency. This success can be largely attributed to its simplicity and clear utility benefits.\n\nAs of January 2021, Litecoin is one of the most widely accepted cryptocurrencies, and more than 2,000 merchants and stores now accept LTC across the globe.\n\nIts main benefit comes from its speed and cost-effectiveness. Litecoin transactions are typically confirmed in just minutes, and transaction fees are nearly negligible. This makes it an attractive alternative to Bitcoin in developing countries, where transaction fees may be the deciding factor on which cryptocurrency to support.\n\nIn late 2020, Litecoin also saw the release of the MimbleWimble (MW) testnet, which is used to test Mimblewimble-based confidential transactions on Litecoin. Once this feature is available on the mainnet, Litecoin users will also benefit from greatly enhanced privacy and fungibility.\n\nRelated Pages:\nCheck out Bitcoin (BTC) — the original cryptocurrency.\n\nCheck out Nano (NANO) — another lightweight, fast cryptocurrency.\n\nGet up to date with the latest Litecoin updates and discussion.\n\nSubscribe to the CoinMarketCap blog for the latest cryptocurrency news and updates.\n\nHow Many Litecoin (LTC) Coins Are There in Circulation?\nLike most proof-of-work (POW) cryptocurrencies, the amount of Litecoin in circulation gradually increases with each newly mined block.\n\nAs of January 2021, 66.245 million LTC have already been mined out of a total maximum supply of 84 million. The Litecoin Foundation recently estimated it will be well over 100 years until Litecoin reaches full dilution (around the year 2140) — since the number of LTC mined per block decreases every four years as part of the block reward halving schedule.\n\nAround 500,000 LTC was instamined on day one after the LTC genesis block was mined and Charlie Lee and presumably other early Litecoin developers were among the first miners.\n\nDespite this, as a fairly distributed asset, the Litecoin developers or Charlie Lee do not receive any direct profits from the operation of Litecoin—other than anything they may earn as part of the regular mining process.\n\nHow Is the Litecoin Network Secured?\nAs a blockchain-based cryptocurrency, Litecoin is secured by incredibly strong cryptographic defenses — making it practically impossible to crack.\n\nLike Bitcoin and several other cryptocurrencies, Litecoin uses the PoW consensus algorithm to ensure transactions are confirmed quickly and without errors. The combined strength of the Litecoin mining network prevents double-spends and a range of other attacks, while ensuring the network has 100% uptime.\n\nWhere Can You Buy Litecoin (LTC)?\nLitecoin is one of the few cryptocurrencies with a wide variety of fiat trading pairs, and can be exchanged for U.S. dollars (USD), Korean won (KRW), euros (EUR) and more when you buy Litecoin. Some of the most prominent names include Huobi Global, Binance, Coinbase Pro, OKEx and Kraken.\n\nLitecoin is one of the few cryptocurrencies with a wide variety of fiat trading pairs, and can be exchanged for U.S. dollars (USD), Korean won (KRW), euros (EUR) and more.

          "context": "Cryptocurrency\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\nJump to navigationJump to search\nNot to be confused with Virtual currency.\n\nA logo for Bitcoin, the first decentralized cryptocurrency\nA cryptocurrency, crypto-currency, or crypto is a binary data designed to work as a medium of exchange wherein individual coin ownership records are stored in a ledger existing in a form of a computerized database using strong cryptography to secure transaction records, to control the creation of additional coins, and to verify the transfer of coin ownership.[1][2] Some crypto schemes use validators to maintain the cryptocurrency. In a proof-of-stake model, owners put up their tokens as collateral. In return, they get authority over the token in proportion to the amount they stake. Generally, these token stakers get additional ownership in the token over time via network fees, newly minted tokens or other such reward mechanisms.[3] Cryptocurrency does not exist in physical form (like paper money) and is typically not issued by a central authority. Cryptocurrencies typically use decentralized control as opposed to a central bank digital currency (CBDC).[4] When a cryptocurrency is minted or created prior to issuance or issued by a single issuer, it is generally considered centralized. When implemented with decentralized control, each cryptocurrency works through distributed ledger technology, typically a blockchain, that serves as a public financial transaction database.[5]\n\nBitcoin, first released as open-source software in 2009, is the first decentralized cryptocurrency.[6] Since the release of bitcoin, many other cryptocurrencies have been created.\n\n\nContents\n1\tHistory\n2\tFormal definition\n2.1\tAltcoins\n2.2\tCrypto token\n3\tArchitecture\n3.1\tBlockchain\n3.2\tNodes\n3.2.1\tTimestamping\n3.3\tMining\n3.3.1\tGPU price rise\n3.4\tWallets\n3.5\tAnonymity\n4\tEconomics\n4.1\tBlock rewards\n4.2\tTransaction fees\n4.3\tExchanges\n4.4\tAtomic swaps\n4.5\tATMs\n4.6\tInitial coin offerings\n5\tTrends\n6\tIncreased regulation in 2021\n6.1\tUnited States\n6.2\tChina\n6.3\tUnited Kingdom\n6.4\tSouth Africa\n6.5\tSouth Korea\n6.6\tTurkey\n6.7\tEl Salvador\n7\tLegality\n7.1\tAdvertising bans\n7.2\tU.S. tax status\n7.3\tThe legal concern of an unregulated global economy\n7.4\tLoss, theft, and fraud\n7.5\tDarknet markets\n8\tReception\n8.1\tSpeculation, fraud and adoption\n8.2\tBanks\n8.3\tEconomic freedom\n8.4\tEnvironmental impact\n8.5\tTechnological limitations\n8.6\tAcademic studies\n8.7\tAid agencies\n9\tSee also\n10\tReferences\n11\tFurther reading\n12\tExternal links\nHistory\nSee also: History of bitcoin\nIn 1983, the American cryptographer David Chaum conceived an anonymous cryptographic electronic money called ecash.[7][8] Later, in 1995, he implemented it through Digicash,[9] an early form of cryptographic electronic payments which required user software in order to withdraw notes from a bank and designate specific encrypted keys before it can be sent to a recipient. This allowed the digital currency to be untraceable by the issuing bank, the government, or any third party.\n\nIn 1996, the National Security Agency published a paper entitled How to Make a Mint: the Cryptography of Anonymous Electronic Cash, describing a Cryptocurrency system, first publishing it in an MIT mailing list[10] and later in 1997, in The American Law Review (Vol. 46, Issue 4).[11]\n\nIn 1998, Wei Dai published a description of \"b-money\", characterized as an anonymous, distributed electronic cash system.[12] Shortly thereafter, Nick Szabo described bit gold.[13] Like bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies that would follow it, bit gold (not to be confused with the later gold-based exchange, BitGold) was described as an electronic currency system which required users to complete a proof of work function with solutions being cryptographically put together and published.\n\nIn 2009, the first decentralized cryptocurrency, bitcoin, was created by presumably pseudonymous developer Satoshi Nakamoto. It used SHA-256, a cryptographic hash function, in its proof-of-work scheme.[14][15] In April 2011, Namecoin was created as an attempt at forming a decentralized DNS, which would make internet censorship very difficult. Soon after, in October 2011, Litecoin was released. It used scrypt as its hash function instead of SHA-256. Another notable cryptocurrency, Peercoin, used a proof-of-work/proof-of-stake hybrid.[16]\n\nOn 6 August 2014, the UK announced its Treasury had commissioned a study of cryptocurrencies, and what role, if any, they could play in the UK economy. The study was also to report on whether regulation should be considered.[17]\n\nIn June 2021, El Salvador became the first country to accept Bitcoin as legal tender, after the Legislative Assembly had voted 62–22 to pass a bill submitted by President Nayib Bukele classifying the cryptocurrency as such.[18]\n\nFormal definition\nAccording to Jan Lansky, a cryptocurrency is a system that meets six conditions:[19]\n\nThe system does not require a central authority; its state is maintained through distributed consensus.\nThe system keeps an overview of cryptocurrency units and their ownership.\nThe system defines whether new cryptocurrency units can be created. If new cryptocurrency units can be created, the system defines the circumstances of their origin and how to determine the ownership of these new units.\nOwnership of cryptocurrency units can be proved exclusively cryptographically.\nThe system allows transactions to be performed in which ownership of the cryptographic units is changed. A transaction statement can only be issued by an entity proving the current ownership of these units.\nIf two different instructions for changing the ownership of the same cryptographic units are simultaneously entered, the system performs at most one of them.\nIn March 2018, the word cryptocurrency was added to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary.[20]\n\nAltcoins\nTokens, cryptocurrencies, and other types of digital assets that are not bitcoin are collectively known as alternative cryptocurrencies,[21][22][23] typically shortened to \"altcoins\" or \"alt coins\".[24][25] Paul Vigna of The Wall Street Journal also described altcoins as \"alternative versions of bitcoin\"[26] given its role as the model protocol for altcoin designers. The term is commonly used to describe coins and tokens created after bitcoin. A list of some cryptocurrencies can be found in the List of cryptocurrencies article.\n\nAltcoins often have underlying differences with bitcoin. For example, Litecoin aims to process a block every 2.5 minutes, rather than bitcoin's 10 minutes, which allows Litecoin to confirm transactions faster than bitcoin.[27] Another example is Ethereum, which has smart contract functionality that allows decentralized applications to be run on its blockchain.[28] Ethereum was the most used blockchain in 2020, according to Bloomberg News.[29] In 2016, it had the largest \"following\" of any altcoin, according to the New York Times.[30]\n\nSignificant rallies across altcoin markets are often referred to as an \"altseason\".[31][32]\n\nCrypto token\nA blockchain account can provide functions other than making payments, for example in decentralized applications or smart contracts. (Units of) fungible tokens are sometimes referred to as crypto tokens (or cryptotokens). These terms are usually reserved for other fungible tokens than the main cryptocurrency of the blockchain, that is, usually, for fungible tokens issued within a smart contract running on top of a blockchain such as Ethereum.[33] There are also non-fungible tokens.\n\nArchitecture\nDecentralized cryptocurrency is produced by the entire cryptocurrency system collectively, at a rate which is defined when the system is created and which is publicly known. In centralized banking and economic systems such as the Federal Reserve System, corporate boards or governments control the supply of currency by printing units of fiat money or demanding additions to digital banking ledgers. In the case of decentralized cryptocurrency, companies or governments cannot produce new units, and have not so far provided backing for other firms, banks or corporate entities which hold asset value measured in it. The underlying technical system upon which decentralized cryptocurrencies are based was created by the group or individual known as Satoshi Nakamoto.[34]\n\nAs of May 2018, over 1,800 cryptocurrency specifications existed.[35] Within a proof-of-work cryptocurrency system such as Bitcoin, the safety, integrity and balance of ledgers is maintained by a community of mutually distrustful parties referred to as miners: who use their computers to help validate and timestamp transactions, adding them to the ledger in accordance with a particular timestamping scheme.[14] In a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain, transactions are validated by holders of the associated cryptocurrency, sometimes grouped together in stake pools.\n\nMost cryptocurrencies are designed to gradually decrease the production of that currency, placing a cap on the total amount of that currency that will ever be in circulation.[36] Compared with ordinary currencies held by financial institutions or kept as cash on hand, cryptocurrencies can be more difficult for seizure by law enforcement.[1]\n\nBlockchain\nMain article: Blockchain\nThe validity of each cryptocurrency's coins is provided by a blockchain. A blockchain is a continuously growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked and secured using cryptography.[34][37] Each block typically contains a hash pointer as a link to a previous block,[37] a timestamp and transaction data.[38] By design, blockchains are inherently resistant to modification of the data. It is \"an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way\".[39] For use as a distributed ledger, a blockchain is typically managed by a peer-to-peer network collectively adhering to a protocol for validating new blocks. Once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all subsequent blocks, which requires collusion of the network majority.\n\nBlockchains are secure by design and are an example of a distributed computing system with high Byzantine fault tolerance. Decentralized consensus has therefore been achieved with a blockchain.[40]\n\nNodes\nIn the world of Cryptocurrency, a node is a computer that connects to a cryptocurrency network. The node supports the relevant cryptocurrency's network through either; relaying transactions, validation or hosting a copy of the blockchain. In terms of relaying transactions each network computer (node) has a copy of the blockchain of the cryptocurrency it supports, when a transaction is made the node creating the transaction broadcasts details of the transaction using encryption to other nodes throughout the node network so that the transaction (and every other transaction) is known.\n\nNode owners are either volunteers, those hosted by the organisation or body responsible for developing the cryptocurrency blockchain network technology or those that are enticed to host a node to receive rewards from hosting the node network.[41]\n\nTimestamping\nCryptocurrencies use various timestamping schemes to \"prove\" the validity of transactions added to the blockchain ledger without the need for a trusted third party.\n\nThe first timestamping scheme invented was the proof-of-work scheme. The most widely used proof-of-work schemes are based on SHA-256 and scrypt.[16]\n\nSome other hashing algorithms that are used for proof-of-work include CryptoNight, Blake, SHA-3, and X11.\n\nThe proof-of-stake is a method of securing a cryptocurrency network and achieving distributed consensus through requesting users to show ownership of a certain amount of currency. It is different from proof-of-work systems that run difficult hashing algorithms to validate electronic transactions. The scheme is largely dependent on the coin, and there's currently no standard form of it. Some cryptocurrencies use a combined proof-of-work and proof-of-stake scheme.[16]\n\nMining\n\nHashcoin mine\nIn cryptocurrency networks, mining is a validation of transactions. For this effort, successful miners obtain new cryptocurrency as a reward. The reward decreases transaction fees by creating a complementary incentive to contribute to the processing power of the network. The rate of generating hashes, which validate any transaction, has been increased by the use of specialized machines such as FPGAs and ASICs running complex hashing algorithms like SHA-256 and scrypt.[42] This arms race for cheaper-yet-efficient machines has existed since the day the first cryptocurrency, bitcoin, was introduced in 2009.[42] With more people venturing into the world of virtual currency, generating hashes for this validation has become far more complex over the years, with miners having to invest large sums of money on employing multiple high performance ASICs. Thus the value of the currency obtained for finding a hash often does not justify the amount of money spent on setting up the machines, the cooling facilities to overcome the heat they produce, and the electricity required to run them.[43] Favorite regions for mining are those with cheap electricity or a cold climate. As of July 2019, bitcoin's electricity consumption is estimated to about 7 gigawatts, 0.2% of the global total, or equivalent to that of Switzerland.[44]\n\nSome miners pool resources, sharing their processing power over a network to split the reward equally, according to the amount of work they contributed to the probability of finding a block. A \"share\" is awarded to members of the mining pool who present a valid partial proof-of-work.\n\nAs of February 2018, the Chinese Government halted trading of virtual currency, banned initial coin offerings and shut down mining. Some Chinese miners have since relocated to Canada.[45] One company is operating data centers for mining operations at Canadian oil and gas field sites, due to low gas prices.[46] In June 2018, Hydro Quebec proposed to the provincial government to allocate 500 MW to crypto companies for mining.[47] According to a February 2018 report from Fortune,[48] Iceland has become a haven for cryptocurrency miners in part because of its cheap electricity.\n\nIn March 2018, the city of Plattsburgh in upstate New York put an 18-month moratorium on all cryptocurrency mining in an effort to preserve natural resources and the \"character and direction\" of the city.[49]\n\nGPU price rise\nAn increase in cryptocurrency mining increased the demand for graphics cards (GPU) in 2017.[50] (The computing power of GPUs makes them well-suited to generating hashes.) Popular favorites of cryptocurrency miners such as Nvidia's GTX 1060 and GTX 1070 graphics cards, as well as AMD's RX 570 and RX 580 GPUs, doubled or tripled in price – or were out of stock.[51] A GTX 1070 Ti which was released at a price of $450 sold for as much as $1100. Another popular card GTX 1060's 6 GB model was released at an MSRP of $250, sold for almost $500. RX 570 and RX 580 cards from AMD were out of stock for almost a year. Miners regularly buy up the entire stock of new GPU's as soon as they are available.[52]\n\nNvidia has asked retailers to do what they can when it comes to selling GPUs to gamers instead of miners. \"Gamers come first for Nvidia,\" said Boris Böhles, PR manager for Nvidia in the German region.[53]\n\nWallets\n\nAn example paper printable bitcoin wallet consisting of one bitcoin address for receiving and the corresponding private key for spending\nMain article: Cryptocurrency wallet\nA cryptocurrency wallet stores the public and private \"keys\" (address) or seed which can be used to receive or spend the cryptocurrency. With the private key, it is possible to write in the public ledger, effectively spending the associated cryptocurrency. With the public key, it is possible for others to send currency to the wallet.\n\nThere exist multiple methods of storing keys or seed in a wallet from using paper wallets which are traditional public, private or seed keys written on paper to using hardware wallets which are dedicated hardware to securely store your wallet information, using a digital wallet which is a computer with a software hosting your wallet information, hosting your wallet using an exchange where cryptocurrency is traded. or by storing your wallet information on a digital medium such as plaintext.[54]\n\nAnonymity\nBitcoin is pseudonymous rather than anonymous in that the cryptocurrency within a wallet is not tied to people, but rather to one or more specific keys (or \"addresses\").[55] Thereby, bitcoin owners are not identifiable, but all transactions are publicly available in the blockchain. Still, cryptocurrency exchanges are often required by law to collect the personal information of their users.[citation needed]\n\nAdditions such as Monero, Zerocoin, Zerocash and CryptoNote have been suggested, which would allow for additional anonymity and fungibility.[56][57]\n\nEconomics\nCryptocurrencies are used primarily outside existing banking and governmental institutions and are exchanged over the Internet.\n\nBlock rewards\nProof-of-work cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, offer block rewards incentives for miners. There has been an implicit belief that whether miners are paid by block rewards or transaction fees does not affect the security of the blockchain, but a study suggests that this may not be the case under certain circumstances.[58]\n\nThe rewards paid to miners increase the supply of the cryptocurrency. By making sure that verifying transactions is a costly business, the integrity of the network can be preserved as long as benevolent nodes control a majority of computing power. The verification algorithm requires a lot of processing power, and thus electricity in order to make verification costly enough to accurately validate public blockchain. Not only do miners have to factor in the costs associated with expensive equipment necessary to stand a chance of solving a hash problem, they further must consider the significant amount of electrical power in search of the solution. Generally, the block rewards outweigh electricity and equipment costs, but this may not always be the case.[59]\n\nThe current value, not the long-term value, of the cryptocurrency supports the reward scheme to incentivize miners to engage in costly mining activities. Some sources claim that the current bitcoin design is very inefficient, generating a welfare loss of 1.4% relative to an efficient cash system. The main source for this inefficiency is the large mining cost, which is estimated to be US$360 Million per year. This translates into users being willing to accept a cash system with an inflation rate of 230% before being better off using bitcoin as a means of payment. However, the efficiency of the bitcoin system can be significantly improved by optimizing the rate of coin creation and minimizing transaction fees. Another potential improvement is to eliminate inefficient mining activities by changing the consensus protocol altogether.[60]\n\nTransaction fees\nTransaction fees for cryptocurrency depend mainly on the supply of network capacity at the time, versus the demand from the currency holder for a faster transaction.[citation needed] The currency holder can choose a specific transaction fee, while network entities process transactions in order of highest offered fee to lowest.[citation needed] Cryptocurrency exchanges can simplify the process for currency holders by offering priority alternatives and thereby determine which fee will likely cause the transaction to be processed in the requested time.[citation needed]\n\nFor ether, transaction fees differ by computational complexity, bandwidth use, and storage needs, while bitcoin transaction fees differ by transaction size and whether the transaction uses SegWit. In September 2018, the median transaction fee for ether corresponded to $0.017,[61] while for bitcoin it corresponded to $0.55.[62]\n\nSome cryptocurrencies have no transaction fees, and instead rely on client-side proof-of-work as the transaction prioritization and anti-spam mechanism.[63][64][65]\n\nExchanges\nMain article: Cryptocurrency exchange\nCryptocurrency exchanges allow customers to trade cryptocurrencies for other assets, such as conventional fiat money, or to trade between different digital currencies.\n\nAtomic swaps\nAtomic swaps are a mechanism where one cryptocurrency can be exchanged directly for another cryptocurrency, without the need for a trusted third party such as an exchange.\n\nATMs\n\nBitcoin ATM\nJordan Kelley, founder of Robocoin, launched the first bitcoin ATM in the United States on 20 February 2014. The kiosk installed in Austin, Texas, is similar to bank ATMs but has scanners to read government-issued identification such as a driver's license or a passport to confirm users' identities.[66]\n\nInitial coin offerings\nAn initial coin offering (ICO) is a controversial means of raising funds for a new cryptocurrency venture. An ICO may be used by startups with the intention of avoiding regulation. However, securities regulators in many jurisdictions, including in the U.S., and Canada, have indicated that if a coin or token is an \"investment contract\" (e.g., under the Howey test, i.e., an investment of money with a reasonable expectation of profit based significantly on the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others), it is a security and is subject to securities regulation. In an ICO campaign, a percentage of the cryptocurrency (usually in the form of \"tokens\") is sold to early backers of the project in exchange for legal tender or other cryptocurrencies, often bitcoin or ether.[67][68][69]\n\nAccording to PricewaterhouseCoopers, four of the 10 biggest proposed initial coin offerings have used Switzerland as a base, where they are frequently registered as non-profit foundations. The Swiss regulatory agency FINMA stated that it would take a \"balanced approach\" to ICO projects and would allow \"legitimate innovators to navigate the regulatory landscape and so launch their projects in a way consistent with national laws protecting investors and the integrity of the financial system.\" In response to numerous requests by industry representatives, a legislative ICO working group began to issue legal guidelines in 2018, which are intended to remove uncertainty from cryptocurrency offerings and to establish sustainable business practices.[70]\n\nTrends\nThe \"market cap\" of any coin is the calculated by multiplying the price by the number of coins in circulation. The total cryptocurrency market cap has historically been dominated by Bitcoin accounting for at least 50% of the market cap value where altcoins have increased and decreased in market cap value in relation to Bitcoin. Bitcoin's value is largely determined by speculation among other technological limiting factors known as block chain rewards coded into the architecture technology of Bitcoin itself. The cryptocurrency market cap follows a trend known as the \"halving\", which is when the block rewards received from Bitcoin are halved due to technological mandated limited factors instilled into Bitcoin which in turn limits the supply of Bitcoin. As the date reaches near of an halving (twice thus far historically) the cryptocurrency market cap increases, followed by a downtrend.[71]\n\nBy mid-June 2021 cryptocurrency as an admittedly extremely volatile asset class for portfolio diversification had begun to be offered by some wealth managers in the US for 401(k)s.[72][73][74]\n\nIncreased regulation in 2021\nThe rise in the popularity of cryptocurrencies and their adoption by financial institutions has led some governments to assess whether regulation is needed to protect users. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has defined cryptocurrency-related services as \"virtual asset service providers\" and recommended that they be regulated with the same money laundering (AML) and know your customer (KYC) requirements as financial institutions.[75]\n\nThe European Commission published a digital finance strategy in September 2020. This included a draft regulation on Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA), which aimed to provide a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets in the EU.[76][77]\n\nOn June 10, 2021, The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision proposed that banks that held cryptocurrency assets must set aside capital to cover all potential losses. For instance, if a bank were to hold bitcoin worth $2 billion, it would be required to set aside enough capital to cover the entire $2 billion. This is a more extreme standard than banks are usually held to when it comes to other assets. However, this is a proposal and not a regulation.\n\nUnited States\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is considering what steps to take. On July 8, 2021, Senator Elizabeth Warren, who is part of the Senate Banking Committee, wrote to the chairman of the SEC and demanded that it provided answers on cryptocurrency regulation by July 28, 2021[78] due to the increase in cryptocurrency exchange use and the danger this poses to consumers.\n\nChina\nOn May 18, 2021, China banned financial institutions and payment companies from being able to provide cryptocurrency transaction related services.[79] This led to a sharp fall in the price of the biggest proof of work cryptocurrencies. For instance, Bitcoin fell 31%, Ethereum fell 44%, Binance Coin fell 32% and Dogecoin fell 30%.[80] Proof of work mining was the next focus, with regulators in popular mining regions citing the use of electricity generated from highly polluting sources such as coal to create Bitcoin and Ethereum.[81]\n\nUnited Kingdom\nIn the United Kingdom, as of 10 January 2021, all cryptocurrency firms, such as exchanges, advisors and professionals that have either a presence, market product or provide services within the UK market must register with the Financial Conduct Authority. Additionally, on June 27, 2021, the financial watchdog demanded that Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange,[82] cease all regulated activities in the UK.[83] Some commentators believe this is a sign of what is to come in terms of stringent regulation of the UK cryptocurrency market.[83]\n\nSouth Africa\nSouth Africa, who has seen a large amount of scams related to cryptocurrency in recent months is said to be putting a regulatory timeline in place, that will produce a regulatory framework in three to six months.[84] The largest scam occurred in April 2021, where the two founders of an African-based cryptocurrency exchange called Africrypt, Raees Cajee and Ameer Cajee, disappeared with $3.8 billion worth of Bitcoin.[85] Additionally, Mirror Trading International disappeared with $170 million worth of cryptocurrency in January 2021.[86]\n\nSouth Korea\nIn March 2021, South Korea implemented new legislation to strengthen their oversight of digital assets. This legislation requires all digital asset managers, providers and exchanges are registered with the Korea Financial Intelligence Unit in order to operate in South Korea.[87] Registering with this unit requires that all exchanges are certified by the Information Security Management System and that they ensure all customers have real name bank accounts, that the CEO and board members of the exchanges have not been convicted of any crimes and that the exchange holds sufficient levels of deposit insurance to cover losses arising from hacks.[87]\n\nTurkey\nSome countries, such as Turkey, have taken a much stricter stance on cryptocurrencies. On 16 April 2021, Turkey's Central Bank, the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey, banned the use of cryptocurrencies and crypto assets for making purchases from April 30, 2021, on grounds that the use of cryptocurrencies for such payments poses significant transaction risks.[88]\n\nEl Salvador\nEl Salvador however has taken a very contrasting approach to other countries who are limiting the use of cryptocurrencies. On June 9, 2021, El Salvador announced that it will adopt Bitcoin as legal tender.[89] El Salvador is the first country in the world to do this.[89]\n\nLegality\nSee also: Legality of bitcoin by country or territory\nThe legal status of cryptocurrencies varies substantially from country to country and is still undefined or changing in many of them. At least one study has shown that broad generalizations about the use of bitcoin in illicit finance are significantly overstated and that blockchain analysis is an effective crime fighting and intelligence gathering tool.[90] While some countries have explicitly allowed their use and trade,[91] others have banned or restricted it. According to the Library of Congress, an \"absolute ban\" on trading or using cryptocurrencies applies in eight countries: Algeria, Bolivia, Egypt, Iraq, Morocco, Nepal, Pakistan, and the United Arab Emirates. An \"implicit ban\" applies in another 15 countries, which include Bahrain, Bangladesh, China, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Indonesia, Iran, Kuwait, Lesotho, Lithuania, Macau, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Taiwan.[92] In the United States and Canada, state and provincial securities regulators, coordinated through the North American Securities Administrators Association, are investigating \"bitcoin scams\" and ICOs in 40 jurisdictions.[93]\n\nVarious government agencies, departments, and courts have classified bitcoin differently. China Central Bank banned the handling of bitcoins by financial institutions in China in early 2014.\n\nIn Russia, though cryptocurrencies are legal, it is illegal to actually purchase goods with any currency other than the Russian ruble.[94] Regulations and bans that apply to bitcoin probably extend to similar cryptocurrency systems.[95]\n\nCryptocurrencies are a potential tool to evade economic sanctions for example against Russia, Iran, or Venezuela. Russia also secretly supported Venezuela with the creation of the petro (El Petro), a national cryptocurrency initiated by the Maduro government to obtain valuable oil revenues by circumventing US sanctions.[citation needed]\n\nIn August 2018, the Bank of Thailand announced its plans to create its own cryptocurrency, the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC).[96]\n\nAdvertising bans\nCryptocurrency advertisements have been temporarily banned on Facebook,[97] Google, Twitter,[98] Bing,[99] Snapchat, LinkedIn and MailChimp.[100] Chinese internet platforms Baidu, Tencent, and Weibo have also prohibited bitcoin advertisements. The Japanese platform Line and the Russian platform Yandex have similar prohibitions.[101]\n\nU.S. tax status\nOn 25 March 2014, the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) ruled that bitcoin will be treated as property for tax purposes. Bitcoin is therefore subject to capital gains tax.[102] Researchers from Oxford and Warwick showed that bitcoin has characteristics similar to the precious metals market rather than the fiat currencies, and were hence in agreement with the IRS decision, even if based on different reasons.[103]\n\nIn July 2019, the IRS issued letters to cryptocurrency owners instructing them to amend returns and pay taxes.[104]\n\nThe legal concern of an unregulated global economy\nAs the popularity of and demand for online currencies has increased since the inception of bitcoin in 2009,[105] so have concerns that such an unregulated person to person global economy that cryptocurrencies offer may become a threat to society. Concerns abound that altcoins may become tools for anonymous web criminals.[106]\n\nCryptocurrency networks display a lack of regulation that has been criticized as enabling criminals who seek to evade taxes and launder money. Money laundering issues are also present in regular bank transfers, however with bank-to-bank wire transfers for instance, the account holder must at least provide a proven identity.\n\nTransactions that occur through the use and exchange of these altcoins are independent from formal banking systems, and therefore can make tax evasion simpler for individuals. Since charting taxable income is based upon what a recipient reports to the revenue service, it becomes extremely difficult to account for transactions made using existing cryptocurrencies, a mode of exchange that is complex and difficult to track.[106]\n\nSystems of anonymity that most cryptocurrencies offer can also serve as a simpler means to launder money. Rather than laundering money through an intricate net of financial actors and offshore bank accounts, laundering money through altcoins can be achieved through anonymous transactions.[106]\n\nLoss, theft, and fraud\nMain article: Cryptocurrency and crime\nIn February 2014 the world's largest bitcoin exchange, Mt. Gox, declared bankruptcy. The company stated that it had lost nearly $473 million of their customers' bitcoins likely due to theft, which Mt. Gox blamed on hackers who exploited transaction malleability problems in the network. This was equivalent to approximately 750,000 bitcoins, or about 7% of all the bitcoins in existence. The price of a bitcoin fell from a high of about $1,160 in December to under $400 in February.[107]\n\nTwo members of the Silk Road Task Force—a multi-agency federal task force that carried out the U.S. investigation of Silk Road—seized bitcoins for their own use in the course of the investigation.[108] DEA agent Carl Mark Force IV, who attempted to extort Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht (\"Dread Pirate Roberts\"), pleaded guilty to money laundering, obstruction of justice, and extortion under color of official right, and was sentenced to 6.5 years in federal prison.[108] U.S. Secret Service agent Shaun Bridges pleaded guilty to crimes relating to his diversion of $800,000 worth of bitcoins to his personal account during the investigation, and also separately pleaded guilty to money laundering in connection with another cryptocurrency theft; he was sentenced to nearly eight years in federal prison.[109]\n\nHomero Josh Garza, who founded the cryptocurrency startups GAW Miners and ZenMiner in 2014, acknowledged in a plea agreement that the companies were part of a pyramid scheme, and pleaded guilty to wire fraud in 2015. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission separately brought a civil enforcement action against Garza, who was eventually ordered to pay a judgment of $9.1 million plus $700,000 in interest. The SEC's complaint stated that Garza, through his companies, had fraudulently sold \"investment contracts representing shares in the profits they claimed would be generated\" from mining.[110]\n\nOn 21 November 2017, the Tether cryptocurrency announced they were hacked, losing $31 million in USDT from their primary wallet.[111] The company has 'tagged' the stolen currency, hoping to 'lock' them in the hacker's wallet (making them unspendable). Tether indicates that it is building a new core for its primary wallet in response to the attack in order to prevent the stolen coins from being used.\n\nIn May 2018, Bitcoin Gold (and two other cryptocurrencies) were hit by a successful 51% hashing attack by an unknown actor, in which exchanges lost estimated $18m.[112] In June 2018, Korean exchange Coinrail was hacked, losing US$37 million worth of altcoin. Fear surrounding the hack was blamed for a $42 billion cryptocurrency market selloff.[113] On 9 July 2018 the exchange Bancor had $23.5 million in cryptocurrency stolen.[114]\n\nThe French regulator Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF) lists 15 websites of companies that solicit investment in cryptocurrency without being authorised to do so in France.[115]\n\nA 2020 EU report found that users had lost crypto-assets worth hundreds of millions of US dollars in security breaches at exchanges and storage providers. From 2011 to 2019, between four and 12 breaches were identified a year. In 2019, thefts were reported to have exceeded a value of $1 billion. Stolen assets “typically find their way to illegal markets and are used to fund further criminal activity”.[116]\n\nDarknet markets\nMain article: Darknet market\nProperties of cryptocurrencies gave them popularity in applications such as a safe haven in banking crises and means of payment, which also led to the cryptocurrency use in controversial settings in the form of online black markets, such as Silk Road.[106] The original Silk Road was shut down in October 2013 and there have been two more versions in use since then. In the year following the initial shutdown of Silk Road, the number of prominent dark markets increased from four to twelve, while the amount of drug listings increased from 18,000 to 32,000.[106]\n\nDarknet markets present challenges in regard to legality. Cryptocurrency used in dark markets are not clearly or legally classified in almost all parts of the world. In the U.S., bitcoins are labelled as \"virtual assets\".[citation needed] This type of ambiguous classification puts pressure on law enforcement agencies around the world to adapt to the shifting drug trade of dark markets.[117][unreliable source?]\n\nReception\nSpeculation, fraud and adoption\nCryptocurrencies have been compared to Ponzi schemes, pyramid schemes[118] and economic bubbles,[119] such as housing market bubbles.[120] Howard Marks of Oaktree Capital Management stated in 2017 that digital currencies were \"nothing but an unfounded fad (or perhaps even a pyramid scheme), based on a willingness to ascribe value to something that has little or none beyond what people will pay for it\", and compared them to the tulip mania (1637), South Sea Bubble (1720), and dot-com bubble (1999).[121] The New Yorker has explained the debate based on interviews with blockchain founders in an article about the “argument over whether Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the blockchain are transforming the world”.[122]\n\nWhile cryptocurrencies are digital currencies that are managed through advanced encryption techniques, many governments have taken a cautious approach toward them, fearing their lack of central control and the effects they could have on financial security.[123] Regulators in several countries have warned against cryptocurrency and some have taken measures to dissuade users.[124] However, research in 2021 by the UK's financial regulator suggested such warnings went unheard, or ignored. Fewer than one in 10 potential cryptocurrency buyers were aware of consumer warnings on the FCA website, and 12% of crypto users were not aware that their holdings were not protected by statutory compensation.[125][126]\n\nAdditionally, many banks do not offer services for cryptocurrencies and can refuse to offer services to virtual-currency companies.[127] Gareth Murphy, a senior central banking officer has stated \"widespread use [of cryptocurrency] would also make it more difficult for statistical agencies to gather data on economic activity, which are used by governments to steer the economy\". He cautioned that virtual currencies pose a new challenge to central banks' control over the important functions of monetary and exchange rate policy.[128] While traditional financial products have strong consumer protections in place, there is no intermediary with the power to limit consumer losses if bitcoins are lost or stolen. One of the features cryptocurrency lacks in comparison to credit cards, for example, is consumer protection against fraud, such as chargebacks.\n\nThe cryptocurrency community refers to pre-mining, hidden launches, ICO or extreme rewards for the altcoin founders as a deceptive practice.[129] It can also be used as an inherent part of a cryptocurrency's design.[130] Pre-mining means currency is generated by the currency's founders prior to being released to the public.[131]\n\nPaul Krugman, winner of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, has repeated numerous times that it is a bubble that will not last[132] and links it to Tulip mania.[133] American business magnate Warren Buffett thinks that cryptocurrency will come to a bad ending.[134] In October 2017, BlackRock CEO Laurence D. Fink called bitcoin an 'index of money laundering'.[135] \"Bitcoin just shows you how much demand for money laundering there is in the world,\" he said.\n\nBanks\nAs the first big Wall Street bank to embrace cryptocurrencies, Morgan Stanley announced on March 17, 2021, that they will be offering access to Bitcoin funds for their wealthy clients through three funds which enable Bitcoin ownership for investors with an aggressive risk tolerance.[136] BNY Mellon on 11 February 2021 announced that it would begin offering cryptocurrency services to its clients.[137]\n\nOn April 20, 2021,[138] Venmo added support to its platform to enable customers to buy, hold and sell cryptocurrencies.[139]\n\nEconomic freedom\nCryptocurrency presents major strides in economic growth and freedom to individuals such as in developing nations as well as those under economic sanctions. The crypto market is known to be easier to access than traditional banks due to less regulations and allows citizens to bypass governments and regulations to mine for cryptocurrency rewards to utilise, trade, and convert for common goods to survive.[140] In countries with high inflation where fiat currency is no longer available to easily utilise to survive, many have turned to cryptocurrency working through online job boards to bypass strict regulations and achieve economic freedom.[141]\n\nEnvironmental impact\nSee also: Bitcoin § Energy consumption and carbon footprint\nMining for proof-of-work cryptocurrencies consumes significant quantities of electricity and has a large associated carbon footprint.[142] In 2017, bitcoin mining was estimated to consume 948MW, equivalent to countries the scale of Angola or Panama, respectively ranked 102nd and 103rd in the world. Proof-of-work blockchains such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Monero were estimated to have added 3 to 15 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions to the atmosphere in the period from 1 January 2016 to 30 June 2017.[143] By November 2018, Bitcoin was estimated to have an annual energy consumption of 45.8TWh, generating 22.0 to 22.9 million tonnes of carbon dioxide, rivalling nations like Jordan and Sri Lanka.[144]\n\nCritics have also identified a large electronic waste problem in disposing of mining rigs.[145]\n\nBitcoin is the least energy-efficient cryptocurrency, using 707.6 kilowatt-hours of electricity per transaction.[146] In comparison, the world's second-largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum, uses 62.56 kilowatt-hours of electricity per transaction.[147] These two cryptocurrencies use a significant amount of electricity per transaction in comparison to some of their competitors with a smaller market capitalisation. For instance, Dogecoin has a relatively small energy use, using 0.12 kilowatt-hours of electricity per transaction.[148] Ripple, which is often referred to as XRP, is the world's most energy efficient cryptocurrency, using 0.0079 kilowatt-hours of electricity per transaction.[149] Additionally, Cardano, which is often referred to as green cryptocurrency, uses only 0.5479 kilowatt-hours of electricity per transaction.\n\nTechnological limitations\nThere are also purely technical elements to consider. For example, technological advancement in cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin result in high up-front costs to miners in the form of specialized hardware and software.[150] Cryptocurrency transactions are normally irreversible after a number of blocks confirm the transaction. Additionally, cryptocurrency private keys can be permanently lost from local storage due to malware, data loss or the destruction of the physical media. This precludes the cryptocurrency from being spent, resulting in its effective removal from the markets.[151]\n\nAcademic studies\nMain article: Ledger (journal)\nIn September 2015, the establishment of the peer-reviewed academic journal Ledger (ISSN 2379-5980) was announced. It covers studies of cryptocurrencies and related technologies, and is published by the University of Pittsburgh.[152]\n\nThe journal encourages authors to digitally sign a file hash of submitted papers, which will then be timestamped into the bitcoin blockchain. Authors are also asked to include a personal bitcoin address in the first page of their papers.[153][154]\n\nAid agencies\nA number of aid agencies have started accepting donations in cryptocurrencies, including the American Red Cross, UNICEF,[155] and the UN World Food Program.\n\nCryptocurrencies make tracking donations easier and have the potential to allow donors to see how their money is used (financial transparency).\n\nChristopher Fabian, principal adviser at UNICEF Innovation said that UNICEF would uphold existing donor protocols, meaning that those making donations online would have to pass rigorous checks before they were allowed to deposit funds to UNICEF.[156][157]",

          "context": "Strong cryptography\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\nJump to navigationJump to search\n\nThis article needs additional citations for verification. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed.\nFind sources: \"Strong cryptography\" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR (December 2007) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)\nStrong cryptography or cryptographic-ally strong are general terms applied to cryptographic systems or components that are considered highly resistant to cryptanalysis.\n\nDemonstrating the resistance of any cryptographic scheme to attack is a complex matter, requiring extensive testing and reviews, preferably in a public forum. Good algorithms and protocols are required, and good system design and implementation is needed as well. For instance, the operating system on which the cryptographic software runs should be as carefully secured as possible. Users may handle passwords insecurely, or trust 'service' personnel overly much, or simply misuse the software. (See social engineering.) \"Strong\" thus is an imprecise term and may not apply in particular situations.\n\n\nContents\n1\tBackground\n2\tCryptographically strong algorithms\n3\tLegal issues\n4\tExamples\n4.1\tStrong\n4.2\tWeak\n5\tNotes\n6\tReferences\n7\tSee also\nBackground\nThe use of computers changed the process of cryptanalysis, famously with Bletchley Park's Colossus. But just as the development of digital computers and electronics helped in cryptanalysis, it also made possible much more complex ciphers. It is typically the case that use of a quality cipher is very efficient, while breaking it requires an effort many orders of magnitude larger - making cryptanalysis so inefficient and impractical as to be effectively impossible.\n\nSince the publication of Data Encryption Standard, the Diffie-Hellman and RSA algorithm in the 1970s, cryptography has had deep connections with abstract mathematics and become a widely used tool in communications, computer networks, and computer security generally.\n\nCryptographically strong algorithms\nThis term \"cryptographically strong\" is often used to describe an encryption algorithm, and implies, in comparison to some other algorithm (which is thus cryptographically weak), greater resistance to attack. But it can also be used to describe hashing and unique identifier and filename creation algorithms. See for example the description of the Microsoft .NET runtime library function Path.GetRandomFileName.[1] In this usage, the term means \"difficult to guess\".\n\nAn encryption algorithm is intended to be unbreakable (in which case it is as strong as it can ever be), but might be breakable (in which case it is as weak as it can ever be) so there is not, in principle, a continuum of strength as the idiom would seem to imply: Algorithm A is stronger than Algorithm B which is stronger than Algorithm C, and so on. The situation is made more complex, and less subsumable into a single strength metric, by the fact that there are many types of cryptanalytic attack and that any given algorithm is likely to force the attacker to do more work to break it when using one attack than another.\n\nThere is only one known unbreakable cryptographic system, the one-time pad, which is not generally possible to use because of the difficulties involved in exchanging one-time pads without their being compromised. So any encryption algorithm can be compared to the perfect algorithm, the one-time pad.\n\nThe usual sense in which this term is (loosely) used, is in reference to a particular attack, brute force key search — especially in explanations for newcomers to the field. Indeed, with this attack (always assuming keys to have been randomly chosen), there is a continuum of resistance depending on the length of the key used. But even so there are two major problems: many algorithms allow use of different length keys at different times, and any algorithm can forgo use of the full key length possible. Thus, Blowfish and RC5 are block cipher algorithms whose design specifically allowed for several key lengths, and who cannot therefore be said to have any particular strength with respect to brute force key search. Furthermore, US export regulations restrict key length for exportable cryptographic products and in several cases in the 1980s and 1990s (e.g., famously in the case of Lotus Notes' export approval) only partial keys were used, decreasing 'strength' against brute force attack for those (export) versions. More or less the same thing happened outside the US as well, as for example in the case of more than one of the cryptographic algorithms in the GSM cellular telephone standard.\n\nThe term is commonly used to convey that some algorithm is suitable for some task in cryptography or information security, but also resists cryptanalysis and has no, or fewer, security weaknesses. Tasks are varied, and might include:\n\ngenerating randomness\nencrypting data\nproviding a method to ensure data integrity\nCryptographically strong would seem to mean that the described method has some kind of maturity, perhaps even approved for use against different kinds of systematic attacks in theory and/or practice. Indeed, that the method may resist those attacks long enough to protect the information carried (and what stands behind the information) for a useful length of time. But due to the complexity and subtlety of the field, neither is almost ever the case. Since such assurances are not actually available in real practice, sleight of hand in language which implies that they are will generally be misleading.\n\nThere will always be uncertainty as advances (e.g., in cryptanalytic theory or merely affordable computer capacity) may reduce the effort needed to successfully use some attack method against an algorithm.\n\nIn addition, actual use of cryptographic algorithms requires their encapsulation in a cryptosystem, and doing so often introduces vulnerabilities which are not due to faults in an algorithm. For example, essentially all algorithms require random choice of keys, and any cryptosystem which does not provide such keys will be subject to attack regardless of any attack resistant qualities of the encryption algorithm(s) used.\n\nLegal issues\nSee also: Cryptography § Forced disclosure of encryption keys\nSince use of strong cryptography makes the job of intelligence agencies more difficult, many countries have enacted laws or regulations restricting or simply banning the non-official use of strong cryptography. For instance, the United States previously defined cryptographic products as munitions since World War II and prohibited export of cryptography beyond a certain 'strength' (measured in part by key size).[citation needed] However, the U.S. restrictions eased in the 1990s along with the rising need for secure e-Commerce and web-connected public software applications. The Clinton Administration issued new rules in 2000 allowing export of products containing strong cryptography, subject to certain limitations.[2] President and government of Russia in 90s has issued a few decrees formally banning uncertified cryptosystems from use by government agencies. Presidential decree of 1995 also attempted to ban individuals from producing and selling cryptography systems without having appropriate license, but it wasn't enforced in any way as it was suspected to be contradictory the Russian Constitution of 1993 and wasn't a law per se.[3][4][5][note 1] The decree of No.313 issued in 2012 further amended previous ones allowing to produce and distribute products with embedded cryptosystems and requiring no license as such, even though it declares some restrictions.[6][7] France had quite strict regulations in this field, but has relaxed them in recent years.[citation needed]\n\nExamples\nStrong\nPGP is generally considered an example of strong cryptography, with versions running under most popular operating systems and on various hardware platforms. The open source standard for PGP operations is OpenPGP, and GnuPG is an implementation of that standard from the FSF. However, the IDEA signature key in classical PGP is only 64bit long, therefore no longer immune against collision attacks.\nOpenPGP therefore uses SHA2 integrity and AES cryptography.\n\nThe AES algorithm is considered strong after being selected in a lengthy selection process that was open and involved numerous tests.\nThe Elliptic curve cryptography is another system which is based on a graphical geometrical function\nThe latest version of TLS protocol (version 1.3), used to secure Internet transactions, is generally considered strong. Several vulnerabilities exist in previous versions, including demonstrated attacks such as POODLE. Worse, some cipher-suites are deliberately weakened to use a 40-bit effective key to allow export under pre-1996 U.S. regulations.\nWeak\nExamples that are not considered cryptographically strong include:\n\nThe DES, whose 56-bit keys allow attacks via exhaustive search.\nTriple-DES (3DES / EDE3-DES). see DES - this also suffers a meanwhile known phenomenon, called the \"sweet32\" or \"birthday oracle\"\nWired Equivalent Privacy which is subject to a number of attacks due to flaws in its design.\nSSL v2 and v3. TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 are also deprecated now [see RFC7525] because of irreversible flaws which are still present by design and because they do not provide elliptical handshake (EC) for ciphers, no modern cryptography, no CCM/GCM ciphermodes. TLS1.x are also announced off by the PCIDSS 3.2 for commercial business/banking implementations on web frontends. Only TLS1.2 and TLS 1.3 are allowed and recommended, modern ciphers, handshakes and ciphermodes must be used exclusively.\nThe MD5 and SHA-1 hash functions.\nThe RC4 stream cipher.\nThe Clipper Chip, a failed initiative of the U.S. government that included key escrow provisions, allowing the government to gain access to the keys.\nThe 40-bit Content Scramble System used to encrypt most DVD-Video discs.\nAlmost all classical ciphers.\nMost rotary ciphers, such as the Enigma machine.\nsome flawy RSA implementations exist which are suffering an algorithm problem, leading to weak, biased keys (\"ROBOT\" Vulnerability, the \"Bleichenbacher Oracle\")\nRSA keys weaker than 2048 bits\nDH keys weaker than 2048 bits\nECDHE keys weaker than 192 bits, also not all known older named curves still in use for this are vetted \"safe\".\nDHE/EDHE is guessable/weak when using/ re-using known default prime values on the server\nSHA-1 integrity (and everything weaker) is no longer immune against collision attacks.\nCBC blockcipher subcoding of ciphertext is considered weak for TLS (CCM/GCM modes are recommended now)",

The timestamp proves that the transaction data existed when the block was published in order to get into its hash. As blocks each contain information about the block previous to it, they form a chain, with each additional block reinforcing the ones before it. Therefore, blockchains are resistant to modification of their data because once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks.\n\nBlockchains are typically managed by a peer-to-peer network for use as a publicly distributed ledger, where nodes collectively adhere to a protocol to communicate and validate new blocks. Although blockchain records are not unalterable as forks are possible, blockchains may be considered secure by design and exemplify a distributed computing system with high Byzantine fault tolerance.[5]\n\nThe blockchain was invented by a person (or group of people) using the name Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 to serve as the public transaction ledger of the cryptocurrency bitcoin.[3] The identity of Satoshi Nakamoto remains unknown to date. The invention of the blockchain for bitcoin made it the first digital currency to solve the double-spending problem without the need of a trusted authority or central server. The bitcoin design has inspired other applications[3][2] and blockchains that are readable by the public and are widely used by cryptocurrencies. The blockchain is considered a type of payment rail.[6] Private blockchains have been proposed for business use but Computerworld called the marketing of such privatized blockchains without a proper security model \"snake oil\".[7] However, others have argued that permissioned blockchains, if carefully designed, may be more decentralized and therefore more secure in practice than permissionless ones.[4][8]\n\n\nContents\n1\tHistory\n2\tStructure\n2.1\tBlocks\n2.2\tDecentralization\n2.3\tOpenness\n2.4\tStandardisation\n3\tUses\n3.1\tCryptocurrencies\n3.2\tSmart contracts\n3.3\tFinancial services\n3.4\tVideo games\n3.5\tEnergy trading\n3.6\tSupply chain\n3.7\tAnti-counterfeiting\n3.8\tHealthcare\n3.9\tDomain names\n3.10\tOther uses\n4\tTypes\n4.1\tPublic blockchains\n4.2\tPrivate blockchains\n4.3\tHybrid blockchains\n4.4\tSidechains\n5\tInteroperability\n6\tHigh energy consumption\n7\tAcademic research\n7.1\tAdoption decision\n7.2\tCollaboration\n7.3\tBlockchain and internal audit\n7.4\tJournals\n8\tSee also\n9\tReferences\n10\tFurther reading\n11\tExternal links\nHistory\n\nBitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin transactions per day (January 2011 – January 2021)\nCryptographer David Chaum first proposed a blockchain-like protocol in his 1982 dissertation \"Computer Systems Established, Maintained, and Trusted by Mutually Suspicious Groups.\"[9] Further work on a cryptographically secured chain of blocks was described in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta.[4][10] They wanted to implement a system wherein document timestamps could not be tampered with. In 1992, Haber, Stornetta, and Dave Bayer incorporated Merkle trees to the design, which improved its efficiency by allowing several document certificates to be collected into one block.[4][11]\n\nThe first blockchain was conceptualized by a person (or group of people) known as Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008. Nakamoto improved the design in an important way using a Hashcash-like method to timestamp blocks without requiring them to be signed by a trusted party and introducing a difficulty parameter to stabilize rate with which blocks are added to the chain.[4] The design was implemented the following year by Nakamoto as a core component of the cryptocurrency bitcoin, where it serves as the public ledger for all transactions on the network.[3]\n\nIn August 2014, the bitcoin blockchain file size, containing records of all transactions that have occurred on the network, reached 20 GB (gigabytes).[12] In January 2015, the size had grown to almost 30 GB, and from January 2016 to January 2017, the bitcoin blockchain grew from 50 GB to 100 GB in size. The ledger size had exceeded 200 GiB by early 2020.[13]\n\nThe words block and chain were used separately in Satoshi Nakamoto's original paper, but were eventually popularized as a single word, blockchain, by 2016.\n\nAccording to Accenture, an application of the diffusion of innovations theory suggests that blockchains attained a 13.5% adoption rate within financial services in 2016, therefore reaching the early adopters phase.[14] Industry trade groups joined to create the Global Blockchain Forum in 2016, an initiative of the Chamber of Digital Commerce.\n\nIn May 2018, Gartner found that only 1% of CIOs indicated any kind of blockchain adoption within their organisations, and only 8% of CIOs were in the short-term \"planning or [looking at] active experimentation with blockchain\".[15] For the year 2019 Gartner reported 5% of CIOs believed blockchain technology was a 'game-changer' for their business.[16]\n\nStructure\n\nBlockchain formation. The main chain (black) consists of the longest series of blocks from the genesis block (green) to the current block. Orphan blocks (purple) exist outside of the main chain.\nA blockchain is a decentralized, distributed, and oftentimes public, digital ledger consisting of records called blocks that is used to record transactions across many computers so that any involved block cannot be altered retroactively, without the alteration of all subsequent blocks.[3][17] This allows the participants to verify and audit transactions independently and relatively inexpensively.[18] A blockchain database is managed autonomously using a peer-to-peer network and a distributed timestamping server. They are authenticated by mass collaboration powered by collective self-interests.[19] Such a design facilitates robust workflow where participants' uncertainty regarding data security is marginal. The use of a blockchain removes the characteristic of infinite reproducibility from a digital asset. It confirms that each unit of value was transferred only once, solving the long-standing problem of double spending. A blockchain has been described as a value-exchange protocol.[20] A blockchain can maintain title rights because, when properly set up to detail the exchange agreement, it provides a record that compels offer and acceptance.\n\nLogically, a blockchain can be seen as consisting of several layers:[21]\n\ninfrastructure (hardware)\nnetworking (node discovery, information propagation and verification)\nconsensus (proof of work, proof of stake)\ndata (blocks, transactions)\napplication (smart contracts/decentralized applications, if applicable)\nBlocks\nBlocks hold batches of valid transactions that are hashed and encoded into a Merkle tree.[3] Each block includes the cryptographic hash of the prior block in the blockchain, linking the two. The linked blocks form a chain.[3] This iterative process confirms the integrity of the previous block, all the way back to the initial block, which is known as the genesis block.[22]\n\nSometimes separate blocks can be produced concurrently, creating a temporary fork. In addition to a secure hash-based history, any blockchain has a specified algorithm for scoring different versions of the history so that one with a higher score can be selected over others. Blocks not selected for inclusion in the chain are called orphan blocks.[22] Peers supporting the database have different versions of the history from time to time. They keep only the highest-scoring version of the database known to them. Whenever a peer receives a higher-scoring version (usually the old version with a single new block added) they extend or overwrite their own database and retransmit the improvement to their peers. There is never an absolute guarantee that any particular entry will remain in the best version of the history forever. Blockchains are typically built to add the score of new blocks onto old blocks and are given incentives to extend with new blocks rather than overwrite old blocks. Therefore, the probability of an entry becoming superseded decreases exponentially[23] as more blocks are built on top of it, eventually becoming very low.[3][24]:ch. 08[25] For example, bitcoin uses a proof-of-work system, where the chain with the most cumulative proof-of-work is considered the valid one by the network. There are a number of methods that can be used to demonstrate a sufficient level of computation. Within a blockchain the computation is carried out redundantly rather than in the traditional segregated and parallel manner.[26]\n\nBlock time\nThe block time is the average time it takes for the network to generate one extra block in the blockchain. Some blockchains create a new block as frequently as every five seconds.[27] By the time of block completion, the included data becomes verifiable. In cryptocurrency, this is practically when the transaction takes place, so a shorter block time means faster transactions. The block time for Ethereum is set to between 14 and 15 seconds, while for bitcoin it is on average 10 minutes.[28]\n\nHard forks\nThis section is an excerpt from Fork (blockchain) § Hard fork.[edit]\nA hard fork is a rule change such that the software validating according to the old rules will see the blocks produced according to the new rules as invalid. In case of a hard fork, all nodes meant to work in accordance with the new rules need to upgrade their software. If one group of nodes continues to use the old software while the other nodes use the new software, a permanent split can occur.\n\nFor example, Ethereum has hard-forked to \"make whole\" the investors in The DAO, which had been hacked by exploiting a vulnerability in its code. In this case, the fork resulted in a split creating Ethereum and Ethereum Classic chains. In 2014 the Nxt community was asked to consider a hard fork that would have led to a rollback of the blockchain records to mitigate the effects of a theft of 50 million NXT from a major cryptocurrency exchange. The hard fork proposal was rejected, and some of the funds were recovered after negotiations and ransom payment. Alternatively, to prevent a permanent split, a majority of nodes using the new software may return to the old rules, as was the case of bitcoin split on 12 March 2013.[29]\n\nA more recent hard-fork example is of Bitcoin in 2017, which resulted in a split creating Bitcoin Cash.[30] The network split was mainly due to a disagreement in how to increase the transactions per second to accommodate for demand.[31]\nDecentralization\nBy storing data across its peer-to-peer network, the blockchain eliminates a number of risks that come with data being held centrally.[3] The decentralized blockchain may use ad hoc message passing and distributed networking. One risk of a lack of a decentralization is a so-called \"51% attack\" where a central entity can gain control of more than half of a network and can manipulate that specific blockchain record at-will, allowing double-spending.[32]\n\nPeer-to-peer blockchain networks lack centralized points of vulnerability that computer crackers can exploit; likewise, it has no central point of failure. Blockchain security methods include the use of public-key cryptography.[33]:5 A public key (a long, random-looking string of numbers) is an address on the blockchain. Value tokens sent across the network are recorded as belonging to that address. A private key is like a password that gives its owner access to their digital assets or the means to otherwise interact with the various capabilities that blockchains now support. Data stored on the blockchain is generally considered incorruptible.[3]\n\nEvery node in a decentralized system has a copy of the blockchain. Data quality is maintained by massive database replication[34] and computational trust. No centralized \"official\" copy exists and no user is \"trusted\" more than any other.[33] Transactions are broadcast to the network using software. Messages are delivered on a best-effort basis. Mining nodes validate transactions,[22] add them to the block they are building, and then broadcast the completed block to other nodes.[24]:ch. 08 Blockchains use various time-stamping schemes, such as proof-of-work, to serialize changes.[35] Alternative consensus methods include proof-of-stake.[22] Growth of a decentralized blockchain is accompanied by the risk of centralization because the computer resources required to process larger amounts of data become more expensive.[36]\n\nOpenness\nOpen blockchains are more user-friendly than some traditional ownership records, which, while open to the public, still require physical access to view. Because all early blockchains were permissionless, controversy has arisen over the blockchain definition. An issue in this ongoing debate is whether a private system with verifiers tasked and authorized (permissioned) by a central authority should be considered a blockchain.[37][38][39][40][41] Proponents of permissioned or private chains argue that the term \"blockchain\" may be applied to any data structure that batches data into time-stamped blocks. These blockchains serve as a distributed version of multiversion concurrency control (MVCC) in databases.[42] Just as MVCC prevents two transactions from concurrently modifying a single object in a database, blockchains prevent two transactions from spending the same single output in a blockchain.[43]:30–31 Opponents say that permissioned systems resemble traditional corporate databases, not supporting decentralized data verification, and that such systems are not hardened against operator tampering and revision.[37][39] Nikolai Hampton of Computerworld said that \"many in-house blockchain solutions will be nothing more than cumbersome databases,\" and \"without a clear security model, proprietary blockchains should be eyed with suspicion.\"[7][44]\n\nPermissionless\nAn advantage to an open, permissionless, or public, blockchain network is that guarding against bad actors is not required and no access control is needed.[23] This means that applications can be added to the network without the approval or trust of others, using the blockchain as a transport layer.[23]\n\nBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies currently secure their blockchain by requiring new entries to include a proof of work. To prolong the blockchain, bitcoin uses Hashcash puzzles. While Hashcash was designed in 1997 by Adam Back, the original idea was first proposed by Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor and Eli Ponyatovski in their 1992 paper \"Pricing via Processing or Combatting Junk Mail\".\n\nIn 2016, venture capital investment for blockchain-related projects was weakening in the USA but increasing in China.[45] Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies use open (public) blockchains. As of April 2018, bitcoin has the highest market capitalization.\n\nPermissioned (private) blockchain\nSee also: Distributed ledger\nPermissioned blockchains use an access control layer to govern who has access to the network.[46] In contrast to public blockchain networks, validators on private blockchain networks are vetted by the network owner. They do not rely on anonymous nodes to validate transactions nor do they benefit from the network effect.[citation needed] Permissioned blockchains can also go by the name of 'consortium' blockchains.[citation needed] It has been argued that permissioned blockchains can guarantee a certain level of decentralization, if carefully designed, as opposed to permissionless blockchains, which are often centralized in practice.[8]\n\nDisadvantages of private blockchain\nNikolai Hampton pointed out in Computerworld that \"There is also no need for a '51 percent' attack on a private blockchain, as the private blockchain (most likely) already controls 100 percent of all block creation resources. If you could attack or damage the blockchain creation tools on a private corporate server, you could effectively control 100 percent of their network and alter transactions however you wished.\"[7] This has a set of particularly profound adverse implications during a financial crisis or debt crisis like the financial crisis of 2007–08, where politically powerful actors may make decisions that favor some groups at the expense of others,[47] and \"the bitcoin blockchain is protected by the massive group mining effort. It's unlikely that any private blockchain will try to protect records using gigawatts of computing power — it's time consuming and expensive.\"[7] He also said, \"Within a private blockchain there is also no 'race'; there's no incentive to use more power or discover blocks faster than competitors. This means that many in-house blockchain solutions will be nothing more than cumbersome databases.\"[7]\n\nBlockchain analysis\nThe analysis of public blockchains has become increasingly important with the popularity of bitcoin, Ethereum, litecoin and other cryptocurrencies.[48] A blockchain, if it is public, provides anyone who wants access to observe and analyse the chain data, given one has the know-how. The process of understanding and accessing the flow of crypto has been an issue for many cryptocurrencies, crypto-exchanges and banks.[49][50] The reason for this is accusations of blockchain enabled cryptocurrencies enabling illicit dark market trade of drugs, weapons, money laundering etc.[51] A common belief has been that cryptocurrency is private and untraceable, thus leading many actors to use it for illegal purposes. This is changing and now specialised tech-companies provide blockchain tracking services, making crypto exchanges, law-enforcement and banks more aware of what is happening with crypto funds and fiat crypto exchanges. The development, some argue, has led criminals to prioritise use of new cryptos such as Monero.[52][53][54] The question is about public accessibility of blockchain data and the personal privacy of the very same data. It is a key debate in cryptocurrency and ultimately in blockchain.[55]\n\nStandardisation\nThere is a growing industrial need for blockchain standards because interoperability is considered critical to widespread adoption.[56] Blockchain technologies show much potential as they provide capabilities that cannot normally be met in any other way if the requirement of interoperability between blockchains and with other technologies is met.[57]\n\nIn April 2016, Standards Australia submitted a proposal to the International Organization for Standardization to consider developing standards to support blockchain technology. This proposal resulted in the creation of ISO Technical Committee 307, Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technologies.[58] The technical committee has working groups relating to blockchain terminology, reference architecture, security and privacy, identity, smart contracts, governance and interoperability for blockchain and DLT, as well as standards specific to industry sectors and generic government requirements.[56][59] More than 50 countries are participating in the standardization process together with external liaisons such as the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT), the European Commission, the International Federation of Surveyors, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE).[59]\n\nMany other national standards bodies and open standards bodies are also working on blockchain standards.[60] These include the National Institute of Standards and Technology[61] (NIST), the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization[62] (CENELEC), the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers[63] (IEEE), the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS), and the Internet Engineering Task Force[64] (IETF).\n\nUses\n\nBitcoin's transactions are recorded on a publicly viewable blockchain.\nBlockchain technology can be integrated into multiple areas. The primary use of blockchains is as a distributed ledger for cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin; there were also a few other operational products which had matured from proof of concept by late 2016.[45] As of 2016, some businesses have been testing the technology and conducting low-level implementation to gauge blockchain's effects on organizational efficiency in their back office.[65]\n\nIn 2019, it was estimated that around $2.9 billion were invested in blockchain technology, which represents an 89% increase from the year prior. Additionally, the International Data Corp has estimated that corporate investment into blockchain technology will reach $12.4 billion by 2022.[66] Furthermore, According to PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), the second-largest professional services network in the world, blockchain technology has the potential to generate an annual business value of more than $3 trillion by 2030. PwC's estimate is further augmented by a 2018 study that they have conducted, in which PwC surveyed 600 business executives and determined that 84% have at least some exposure to utilizing blockchain technology, which indicts a significant demand and interest in blockchain technology.[67]\n\nIndividual use of blockchain technology has also greatly increased since 2016. According to statistics in 2020, there were more than 40 million blockchain wallets in 2020 in comparison to around 10 million blockchain wallets in 2016.[68]\n\nCryptocurrencies\nMain article: Cryptocurrency\nMost cryptocurrencies use blockchain technology to record transactions. For example, the bitcoin network and Ethereum network are both based on blockchain. On 8 May 2018 Facebook confirmed that it would open a new blockchain group[69] which would be headed by David Marcus, who previously was in charge of Messenger. Facebook's planned cryptocurrency platform, Libra (now known as Diem), was formally announced on June 18, 2019.[70][71]\n\nThe criminal enterprise Silk Road, which operated on Tor, utilized cryptocurrency for payments, some of which the US federal government has seized through research on the blockchain and forfeiture.[72]\n\nGovernments have mixed policies on the legality of their citizens or banks owning cryptocurrencies. China implements blockchain technology in several industries including a national digital currency which launched in 2020.[73][74] In order to strengthen their respective currencies, Western governments including the European Union and the United States have initiated similar projects.[75]\n\nSmart contracts\nMain article: Smart contract\nBlockchain-based smart contracts are proposed contracts that can be partially or fully executed or enforced without human interaction.[76] One of the main objectives of a smart contract is automated escrow. A key feature of smart contracts is that they do not need a trusted third party (such as a trustee) to act as an intermediary between contracting entities -the blockchain network executes the contract on its own. This may reduce friction between entities when transferring value and could subsequently open the door to a higher level of transaction automation.[77] An IMF staff discussion from 2018 reported that smart contracts based on blockchain technology might reduce moral hazards and optimize the use of contracts in general. But \"no viable smart contract systems have yet emerged.\" Due to the lack of widespread use their legal status was unclear.[78][79]\n\nFinancial services\nAccording to Reason, many banks have expressed interest in implementing distributed ledgers for use in banking and are cooperating with companies creating private blockchains,[80][81][82] and according to a September 2016 IBM study, this is occurring faster than expected.[83]\n\nBanks are interested in this technology because it has potential to speed up back office settlement systems.[84]\n\nBanks such as UBS are opening new research labs dedicated to blockchain technology in order to explore how blockchain can be used in financial services to increase efficiency and reduce costs.[85][86]\n\nBerenberg, a German bank, believes that blockchain is an \"overhyped technology\" that has had a large number of \"proofs of concept\", but still has major challenges, and very few success stories.[87]\n\nIn December 2018, Bitwala launched Europe's first regulated blockchain banking solution that enables users to manage both their bitcoin and euro deposits in one place with the safety and convenience of a German bank account. The bank account is hosted by the Berlin-based solarisBank.[88]\n\nMojaloop is designed to deliver financial support to people living in areas underserved by banks. It of use to migrants sending remittances[89]\n\nTokenization of stocks is also occurring[90] and some cryptocurrency exchanges are already offering so-called \"stock tokens\".[91]\n\nThe blockchain has also given rise to Initial coin offerings (ICOs) as well as a new category of digital asset called Security Token Offerings (STOs), also sometimes referred to as Digital Security Offerings (DSOs).[92] STO/DSOs may be conducted privately or on a public, regulated stock exchange and are used to tokenize traditional assets such as company shares as well as more innovative ones like intellectual property, real estate, art, or individual products. A number of companies are active in this space providing services for compliant tokenization, private STOs, and public STOs.\n\nVideo games\nA blockchain game CryptoKitties, launched in November 2017.[93] The game made headlines in December 2017 when a cryptokitty character -a virtual pet- was sold for more than US$100,000.[94] CryptoKitties also illustrated scalability problems for games on Ethereum when it created significant congestion on the Ethereum network with approximately 30% of all Ethereum transactions being for the game.[95][96]\n\nEnergy trading\nBlockchain is also being used in peer-to-peer energy trading.[97][98][99]\n\nSupply chain\nThere have been several different efforts to employ blockchains in supply chain management.\n\nPrecious commodities mining — Blockchain technology has been used for tracking the origins of gemstones and other precious commodities. In 2016, The Wall Street Journal reported that the blockchain technology company, Everledger was partnering with IBM's blockchain-based tracking service to trace the origin of diamonds to ensure that they were ethically mined.[100] As of 2019, the Diamond Trading Company (DTC) has been involved in building a diamond trading supply chain product called Tracr.[101]\nFood supply — Blockchain technology has been used to allow retailers and consumers to track the provenance of meat and other food products from their origins to stores and restaurants.[102] As of 2018, Walmart and IBM were running a trial to use a blockchain-backed system for supply chain monitoring for lettuce and spinach — all nodes of the blockchain were administered by Walmart and were located on the IBM cloud.[103] One cited benefit is that the system could enable rapid tracing of contaminated produce. Some analysts are less convinced that most consumers will be that interested in this capability.[101]\nSoftware development — The Linux Foundation's blockchain initiative, Hyperledger Grid was started in 2015 to develop open components for blockchain supply chain services.[104][105]\nAnti-counterfeiting\nBlockchain could be used in detecting counterfeits by associating unique identifiers to products, documents and shipments, and storing records associated to transactions that cannot be forged or altered.[106][107] It is however argued that blockchain technology needs to be supplemented with technologies that provide a strong binding between physical objects and blockchain systems.[108] The EUIPO established an Anti-Counterfeiting Blockathon Forum, with the objective of \"defining, piloting and implementing\" an anti-counterfeiting infrastructure at the European level.[109][110] The Dutch Standardisation organisation NEN uses blockchain together with QR Codes to authenticate certificates.[111]\n\nHealthcare\nIn response to the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, The Wall Street Journal reported that Ernst & Young was working on a blockchain to help employers, governments, airlines and others keep track of people who have had antibody tests and could be immune to the virus. Hospitals and vendors also utilized a blockchain for needed medical equipment. Additionally, blockchain technology was being used in China to speed up the time it takes for health insurance payments to be paid to health-care providers and patients.[112]\n\nDomain names\nThere are several different efforts to offer domain name services via blockchain. These domain names can be controlled by the use of a private key, which purport to allow for uncensorable websites. This would also bypass a registrar's ability to suppress domains used for fraud, abuse, or illegal content.[113]\n\nNamecoin is a cryptocurrency that supports the \".bit\" top-level domain (TLD). Namecoin was forked from bitcoin in 2011. The .bit TLD is not sanctioned by ICANN, instead requiring an alternative DNS root.[113] As of 2015, it was used by 28 websites, out of 120,000 registered names.[114] Namecoin was dropped by OpenNIC in 2019, due to malware and potential other legal issues.[115] Other blockchain alternatives to ICANN include The Handshake Network,[114] EmerDNS, and Unstoppable Domains.[113]\n\nSpecific TLDs include \".eth\", \".luxe\", and \".kred\", which are associated with the Ethereum blockchain through the Ethereum Name Service (ENS). The .kred TLD also acts an alternative to conventional cryptocurrency wallet addresses, as a convenience for transferring cryptocurrency.[116]\n\nOther uses\nBlockchain technology can be used to create a permanent, public, transparent ledger system for compiling data on sales, tracking digital use and payments to content creators, such as wireless users[117] or musicians.[118] The Gartner 2019 CIO Survey reported 2% of higher education respondents had launched blockchain projects and another 18% were planning academic projects in the next 24 months.[119] In 2017, IBM partnered with ASCAP and PRS for Music to adopt blockchain technology in music distribution.[120] Imogen Heap's Mycelia service has also been proposed as blockchain-based alternative \"that gives artists more control over how their songs and associated data circulate among fans and other musicians.\"[121][122]\n\nNew distribution methods are available for the insurance industry such as peer-to-peer insurance, parametric insurance and microinsurance following the adoption of blockchain.[123][124] The sharing economy and IoT are also set to benefit from blockchains because they involve many collaborating peers.[125] The use of blockchain in libraries is being studied with a grant from the U.S. Institute of Museum and Library Services.[126]\n\nOther designs include:\n\nHyperledger is a cross-industry collaborative effort from the Linux Foundation to support blockchain-based distributed ledgers, with projects under this initiative including Hyperledger Burrow (by Monax) and Hyperledger Fabric (spearheaded by IBM).[127]\nQuorum – a permissionable private blockchain by JPMorgan Chase with private storage, used for contract applications.[128]\nTezos, decentralized voting.[43]:94\nProof of Existence is an online service that verifies the existence of computer files as of a specific time.[129]\nTypes\nCurrently, there are at least four types of blockchain networks — public blockchains, private blockchains, consortium blockchains and hybrid blockchains.\n\nPublic blockchains\nA public blockchain has absolutely no access restrictions. Anyone with an Internet connection can send transactions to it as well as become a validator (i.e., participate in the execution of a consensus protocol).[130][self-published source?] Usually, such networks offer economic incentives for those who secure them and utilize some type of a Proof of Stake or Proof of Work algorithm.\n\nSome of the largest, most known public blockchains are the bitcoin blockchain and the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nPrivate blockchains\nA private blockchain is permissioned.[46] One cannot join it unless invited by the network administrators. Participant and validator access is restricted. To distinguish between open blockchains and other peer-to-peer decentralized database applications that are not open ad-hoc compute clusters, the terminology Distributed Ledger (DLT) is normally used for private blockchains.\n\nHybrid blockchains\nA hybrid blockchain has a combination of centralized and decentralized features.[131] The exact workings of the chain can vary based on which portions of centralization decentralization are used.\n\nSidechains\nA sidechain is a designation for a blockchain ledger that runs in parallel to a primary blockchain.[132][133] Entries from the primary blockchain (where said entries typically represent digital assets) can be linked to and from the sidechain; this allows the sidechain to otherwise operate independently of the primary blockchain (e.g., by using an alternate means of record keeping, alternate consensus algorithm, etc.).[134]\n\nInteroperability\nWith the increasing number of blockchain systems appearing, even only those that support cryptocurrencies, blockchain interoperability is becoming a topic of major importance. The objective is to support transferring assets from one blockchain system to another blockchain system. Wegner[135] stated that \"interoperability is the ability of two or more software components to cooperate despite differences in language, interface, and execution platform\". The objective of blockchain interoperability is therefore to support such cooperation among blockchain systems, despite those kinds of differences.\n\nThere are already several blockchain interoperability solutions available.[136] They can be classified in three categories: cryptocurrency interoperability approaches, blockchain engines, and blockchain connectors.\n\nThe IETF has a recent Blockchain-interop working group that already produced the draft of a blockchain interoperability architecture.[137]\n\nHigh energy consumption\nBlockchain mining — the peer-to-peer computer computations by which transactions are validated and verified — requires a significant amount of energy. The Bank for International Settlements criticized the public proof-of-work blockchains for high energy consumption.[138][139][140] In a 2021 study conducted at Cambridge University, researchers determined that Bitcoin (at 121.36 terawatt-hours per year) uses more electricity annually than Argentina (at 121 TWh) and the Netherlands (at 108.8 TWh).[141] According to Digiconomist, one bitcoin transaction requires about 707.6 kilowatt-hours of electrical energy, the amount of energy the average U.S. household consumes in 24 days.[142]\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen called Bitcoin \"an extremely inefficient way to conduct transactions\", saying \"the amount of energy consumed in processing those transactions is staggering.\"[143] \"Bitcoin uses more electricity per transaction than any other method known to mankind\", Bill Gates said. \"It's not a great climate thing.\"[144]\n\nNicholas Weaver, of the International Computer Science Institute at the University of California, Berkeley, examined blockchain's online security, and the energy efficiency of proof-of-work public blockchains, and in both cases found it grossly inadequate.[145][146] The 31–45 TWh of electricity used for bitcoin in 2018 produced 17–22.9 MtCO2.[147][148]\n\nInside the cryptocurrency industry, concern about high energy consumption has led some companies to consider moving from the proof of work blockchain model to the less energy-intensive proof of stake model.[149]\n\nAcademic research\n\nBlockchain panel discussion at the first IEEE Computer Society TechIgnite conference\nIn October 2014, the MIT Bitcoin Club, with funding from MIT alumni, provided undergraduate students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology access to $100 of bitcoin. The adoption rates, as studied by Catalini and Tucker (2016), revealed that when people who typically adopt technologies early are given delayed access, they tend to reject the technology.[150]\n\nAdoption decision\nMotivations for adopting blockchain technology (an aspect of innovation adoptation) have been investigated by researchers. Janssen et al. provided a framework for analysis.[151] Koens & Poll pointed out that adoption could be heavily driven by non-technical factors.[152] Based on behavioral models, Li[153] discussed the differences between adoption at the individual level and organizational levels.\n\nCollaboration\nScholars in business and management have started studying the role of blockchains to support collaboration.[154][155] It has been argued that blockchains can foster both cooperation (i.e., prevention of opportunistic behavior) and coordination (i.e., communication and information sharing). Thanks to reliability, transparency, traceability of records, and information immutability, blockchains facilitate collaboration in a way that differs both from the traditional use of contracts and from relational norms.[156] Contrary to contracts, blockchains do not directly rely on the legal system to enforce agreements.[157] In addition, contrary to the use of relational norms, blockchains do not require trust or direct connections between collaborators.\n\nBlockchain and internal audit\nExternal video\nvideo icon Blockchain Basics & Cryptography, Gary Gensler, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 0:30[158]\nThe need for internal audit to provide effective oversight of organizational efficiency will require a change in the way that information is accessed in new formats.[159] Blockchain adoption requires a framework to identify the risk of exposure associated with transactions using blockchain. The Institute of Internal Auditors has identified the need for internal auditors to address this transformational technology. New methods are required to develop audit plans that identify threats and risks. The Internal Audit Foundation study, Blockchain and Internal Audit, assesses these factors.[160] The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants has outlined new roles for auditors as a result of blockchain.[161]\n\nJournals\nMain article: Ledger (journal)\nIn September 2015, the first peer-reviewed academic journal dedicated to cryptocurrency and blockchain technology research, Ledger, was announced. The inaugural issue was published in December 2016.[162] The journal covers aspects of mathematics, computer science, engineering, law, economics and philosophy that relate to cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin.[163][164]\n\nThe journal encourages authors to digitally sign a file hash of submitted papers, which are then timestamped into the bitcoin blockchain. Authors are also asked to include a personal bitcoin address in the first page of their papers for non-repudiation purposes.[165]",

The word \"décentralisation\" came into usage in the 1820s.[2] \"Centralization\" entered written English in the first third of the 1800s;[3] mentions of decentralization also first appear during those years. In the mid-1800s Tocqueville would write that the French Revolution began with \"a push towards decentralization...[but became,] in the end, an extension of centralization.\"[4] In 1863, retired French bureaucrat Maurice Block wrote an article called \"Decentralization\" for a French journal that reviewed the dynamics of government and bureaucratic centralization and recent French efforts at decentralization of government functions.[5]\n\nIdeas of liberty and decentralization were carried to their logical conclusions during the 19th and 20th centuries by anti-state political activists calling themselves \"anarchists\", \"libertarians\", and even decentralists. Tocqueville was an advocate, writing: \"Decentralization has, not only an administrative value but also a civic dimension since it increases the opportunities for citizens to take interest in public affairs; it makes them get accustomed to using freedom. And from the accumulation of these local, active, persnickety freedoms, is born the most efficient counterweight against the claims of the central government, even if it were supported by an impersonal, collective will.\"[6] Pierre-Joseph Proudhon (1809–1865), influential anarchist theorist[7][8] wrote: \"All my economic ideas as developed over twenty-five years can be summed up in the words: agricultural-industrial federation. All my political ideas boil down to a similar formula: political federation or decentralization.\"[9]\n\nIn the early 20th century, America's response to the centralization of economic wealth and political power was a decentralist movement. It blamed large-scale industrial production for destroying middle-class shop keepers and small manufacturers and promoted increased property ownership and a return to small scale living. The decentralist movement attracted Southern Agrarians like Robert Penn Warren, as well as journalist Herbert Agar.[10] New Left and libertarian individuals who identified with social, economic, and often political decentralism through the ensuing years included Ralph Borsodi, Wendell Berry, Paul Goodman, Carl Oglesby, Karl Hess, Donald Livingston, Kirkpatrick Sale (author of Human Scale),[11] Murray Bookchin,[12] Dorothy Day,[13] Senator Mark O. Hatfield,[14] Mildred J. Loomis[15] and Bill Kauffman.[16]\n\n\nDecentralization was one of ten Megatrends identified in this best seller\nLeopold Kohr, author of the 1957 book The Breakdown of Nations – known for its statement \"Whenever something is wrong, something is too big\" – was a major influence on E. F. Schumacher, author of the 1973 bestseller Small Is Beautiful: A Study of Economics As If People Mattered.[17][18] In the next few years a number of best-selling books promoted decentralization.\n\nDaniel Bell's The Coming of Post-Industrial Society[4] discussed the need for decentralization and a \"comprehensive overhaul of government structure to find the appropriate size and scope of units\", as well as the need to detach functions from current state boundaries, creating regions based on functions like water, transport, education and economics which might have \"different 'overlays' on the map.\"[19][20] Alvin Toffler published Future Shock (1970) and The Third Wave (1980). Discussing the books in a later interview, Toffler said that industrial-style, centralized, top-down bureaucratic planning would be replaced by a more open, democratic, decentralized style which he called \"anticipatory democracy\".[21] Futurist John Naisbitt's 1982 book \"Megatrends\" was on The New York Times Best Seller list for more than two years and sold 14 million copies.[22] Naisbitt's book outlines 10 \"megatrends\", the fifth of which is from centralization to decentralization.[23] In 1996 David Osborne and Ted Gaebler had a best selling book Reinventing Government proposing decentralist public administration theories which became labeled the \"New Public Management\".[24]\n\nStephen Cummings wrote that decentralization became a \"revolutionary megatrend\" in the 1980s.[25] In 1983 Diana Conyers asked if decentralization was the \"latest fashion\" in development administration.[26] Cornell University's project on Restructuring Local Government states that decentralization refers to the \"global trend\" of devolving responsibilities to regional or local governments.[27] Robert J. Bennett's Decentralization, Intergovernmental Relations and Markets: Towards a Post-Welfare Agenda describes how after World War II governments pursued a centralized \"welfarist\" policy of entitlements which now has become a \"post-welfare\" policy of intergovernmental and market-based decentralization.[27]\n\nIn 1983, \"Decentralization\" was identified as one of the \"Ten Key Values\" of the Green Movement in the United States.\n\nAccording to a 1999 United Nations Development Programme report:\n\n\"... A large number of developing and transitional countries have embarked on some form of decentralization programmes. This trend is coupled with a growing interest in the role of civil society and the private sector as partners to governments in seeking new ways of service delivery...Decentralization of governance and the strengthening of local governing capacity is in part also a function of broader societal trends. These include, for example, the growing distrust of government generally, the spectacular demise of some of the most centralized regimes in the world (especially the Soviet Union) and the emerging separatist demands that seem to routinely pop up in one or another part of the world. The movement toward local accountability and greater control over one's destiny is, however, not solely the result of the negative attitude towards central government. Rather, these developments, as we have already noted, are principally being driven by a strong desire for greater participation of citizens and private sector organizations in governance.\"[28]\n\nOverview\nSystems approach\n\nGraphical comparison of centralized and decentralized system\nThose studying the goals and processes of implementing decentralization often use a systems theory approach, which according to the United Nations Development Programme report applies to the topic of decentralization \"a whole systems perspective, including levels, spheres, sectors and functions and seeing the community level as the entry point at which holistic definitions of development goals are from the people themselves and where it is most practical to support them. It involves seeing multi-level frameworks and continuous, synergistic processes of interaction and iteration of cycles as critical for achieving wholeness in a decentralized system and for sustaining its development.\"[29]\n\nHowever, it has been seen as part of a systems approach. Norman Johnson of Los Alamos National Laboratory wrote in a 1999 paper: \"A decentralized system is where some decisions by the agents are made without centralized control or processing. An important property of agent systems is the degree of connectivity or connectedness between the agents, a measure global flow of information or influence. If each agent is connected (exchange states or influence) to all other agents, then the system is highly connected.\"[30]\n\nUniversity of California, Irvine's Institute for Software Research's \"PACE\" project is creating an \"architectural style for trust management in decentralized applications.\" It adopted Rohit Khare's definition of decentralization: \"A decentralized system is one which requires multiple parties to make their own independent decisions\" and applies it to Peer-to-peer software creation, writing:\n\n...In such a decentralized system, there is no single centralized authority that makes decisions on behalf of all the parties. Instead each party, also called a peer, makes local autonomous decisions towards its individual goals which may possibly conflict with those of other peers. Peers directly interact with each other and share information or provide service to other peers. An open decentralized system is one in which the entry of peers is not regulated. Any peer can enter or leave the system at any time...[31]\n\nGoals\nDecentralization in any area is a response to the problems of centralized systems. Decentralization in government, the topic most studied, has been seen as a solution to problems like economic decline, government inability to fund services and their general decline in performance of overloaded services, the demands of minorities for a greater say in local governance, the general weakening legitimacy of the public sector and global and international pressure on countries with inefficient, undemocratic, overly centralized systems.[32] The following four goals or objectives are frequently stated in various analyses of decentralization.\n\nParticipation\nIn decentralization, the principle of subsidiarity is often invoked. It holds that the lowest or least centralized authority that is capable of addressing an issue effectively should do so. According to one definition: \"Decentralization, or decentralizing governance, refers to the restructuring or reorganization of authority so that there is a system of co-responsibility between institutions of governance at the central, regional and local levels according to the principle of subsidiarity, thus increasing the overall quality and effectiveness of the system of governance while increasing the authority and capacities of sub-national levels.\"[33]\n\nDecentralization is often linked to concepts of participation in decision-making, democracy, equality and liberty from a higher authority.[34][35] Decentralization enhances the democratic voice.[27] Theorists believe that local representative authorities with actual discretionary powers are the basis of decentralization that can lead to local efficiency, equity and development.\"[36] Columbia University's Earth Institute identified one of three major trends relating to decentralization: \"increased involvement of local jurisdictions and civil society in the management of their affairs, with new forms of participation, consultation, and partnerships.\"[6]\n\nDecentralization has been described as a \"counterpoint to globalization [which] removes decisions from the local and national stage to the global sphere of multi-national or non-national interests. Decentralization brings decision-making back to the sub-national levels\". Decentralization strategies must account for the interrelations of global, regional, national, sub-national, and local levels.[37]\n\nDiversity\nNorman L. Johnson writes that diversity plays an important role in decentralized systems like ecosystems, social groups, large organizations, political systems. \"Diversity is defined to be unique properties of entities, agents, or individuals that are not shared by the larger group, population, structure. Decentralized is defined as a property of a system where the agents have some ability to operate \"locally.\" Both decentralization and diversity are necessary attributes to achieve the self-organizing properties of interest.\"[30]\n\nAdvocates of political decentralization hold that greater participation by better informed diverse interests in society will lead to more relevant decisions than those made only by authorities on the national level.[38] Decentralization has been described as a response to demands for diversity.[6][39]\n\nEfficiency\nIn business, decentralization leads to a management by results philosophy which focuses on definite objectives to be achieved by unit results.[40] Decentralization of government programs is said to increase efficiency – and effectiveness – due to reduction of congestion in communications, quicker reaction to unanticipated problems, improved ability to deliver services, improved information about local conditions, and more support from beneficiaries of programs.[41]\n\nFirms may prefer decentralization because it ensures efficiency by making sure that managers closest to the local information make decisions and in a more timely fashion; that their taking responsibility frees upper management for long term strategics rather than day-to-day decision-making; that managers have hands on training to prepare them to move up the management hierarchy; that managers are motivated by having the freedom to exercise their own initiative and creativity; that managers and divisions are encouraged to prove that they are profitable, instead of allowing their failures to be masked by the overall profitability of the company.[42]\n\nThe same principles can be applied to the government. Decentralization promises to enhance efficiency through both inter-governmental competitions with market features and fiscal discipline which assigns tax and expenditure authority to the lowest level of government possible. It works best where members of the subnational government have strong traditions of democracy, accountability, and professionalism.[27]\n\nConflict resolution\nEconomic and/or political decentralization can help prevent or reduce conflict because they reduce actual or perceived inequities between various regions or between a region and the central government.[43] Dawn Brancati finds that political decentralization reduces intrastate conflict unless politicians create political parties that mobilize minority and even extremist groups to demand more resources and power within national governments. However, the likelihood this will be done depends on factors like how democratic transitions happen and features like a regional party's proportion of legislative seats, a country's number of regional legislatures, elector procedures, and the order in which national and regional elections occur. Brancati holds that decentralization can promote peace if it encourages statewide parties to incorporate regional demands and limit the power of regional parties.[44]\n\nProcesses\nInitiation\nThe processes by which entities move from a more to a less centralized state vary. They can be initiated from the centers of authority (\"top-down\") or from individuals, localities or regions (\"bottom-up\"),[45] or from a \"mutually desired\" combination of authorities and localities working together.[46] Bottom-up decentralization usually stresses political values like local responsiveness and increased participation and tends to increase political stability. Top-down decentralization may be motivated by the desire to \"shift deficits downwards\" and find more resources to pay for services or pay off government debt.[45] Some hold that decentralization should not be imposed, but done in a respectful manner.[47]\n\nAppropriate size\nGauging the appropriate size or scale of decentralized units has been studied in relation to the size of sub-units of hospitals[48] and schools,[32] road networks,[49] administrative units in business[50] and public administration, and especially town and city governmental areas and decision making bodies.[51][52]\n\nIn creating planned communities (\"new towns\"), it is important to determine the appropriate population and geographical size. While in earlier years small towns were considered appropriate, by the 1960s, 60,000 inhabitants was considered the size necessary to support a diversified job market and an adequate shopping center and array of services and entertainment. Appropriate size of governmental units for revenue raising also is a consideration.[53]\n\nEven in bioregionalism, which seeks to reorder many functions and even the boundaries of governments according to physical and environmental features, including watershed boundaries and soil and terrain characteristics, appropriate size must be considered. The unit may be larger than many decentralist bioregionalists prefer.[54]\n\nInadvertent or silent\nDecentralization ideally happens as a careful, rational, and orderly process, but it often takes place during times of economic and political crisis, the fall of a regime and the resultant power struggles. Even when it happens slowly, there is a need for experimentation, testing, adjusting, and replicating successful experiments in other contexts. There is no one blueprint for decentralization since it depends on the initial state of a country and the power and views of political interests and whether they support or oppose decentralization.[55]\n\nDecentralization usually is a conscious process based on explicit policies. However, it may occur as \"silent decentralization\" in the absence of reforms as changes in networks, policy emphasize and resource availability lead inevitably to a more decentralized system.[56]\n\nAsymmetry\nDecentralization may be uneven and \"asymmetric\" given any one country's population, political, ethnic and other forms of diversity. In many countries, political, economic and administrative responsibilities may be decentralized to the larger urban areas, while rural areas are administered by the central government. Decentralization of responsibilities to provinces may be limited only to those provinces or states which want or are capable of handling responsibility. Some privatization may be more appropriate to an urban than a rural area; some types of privatization may be more appropriate for some states and provinces but not others.[57]\n\nMeasurement\nMeasuring the amount of decentralization, especially politically, is difficult because different studies of it use different definitions and measurements. An OECD study quotes Chanchal Kumar Sharma as stating:[58] \"a true assessment of the degree of decentralization in a country can be made only if a comprehensive approach is adopted and rather than trying to simplify the syndrome of characteristics into the single dimension of autonomy, interrelationships of various dimensions of decentralization are taken into account.\"[59]\n\nDeterminants\nThe academic literature frequently mentions the following factors as determinants of decentralization:[60]\n\n\"The number of major ethnic groups\"\n\"The degree of territorial concentration of those groups\"\n\"The existence of ethnic networks and communities across the border of the state\"\n\"The country’s dependence on natural resources and the degree to which those resources are concentrated in the region’s territory\"\n\"The country’s per capita income relative to that in other regions\"\nThe presence of self-determination movements\nGovernment decentralization\nHistorians have described the history of governments and empires in terms of centralization and decentralization. In his 1910 The History of Nations Henry Cabot Lodge wrote that Persian king Darius I (550–486 BC) was a master of organization and \"for the first time in history centralization becomes a political fact.\" He also noted that this contrasted with the decentralization of Ancient Greece.[61] Since the 1980s a number of scholars have written about cycles of centralization and decentralizations. Stephen K. Sanderson wrote that over the last 4000 years chiefdoms and actual states have gone through sequences of centralization and decentralization of economic, political and social power.[62] Yildiz Atasoy writes this process has been going on \"since the Stone Age\" through not just chiefdoms and states, but empires and today's \"hegemonic core states\".[63] Christopher K. Chase-Dunn and Thomas D. Hall review other works that detail these cycles, including works which analyze the concept of core elites which compete with state accumulation of wealth and how their \"intra-ruling-class competition accounts for the rise and fall of states\" and their phases of centralization and decentralization.[64]\n\nRising government expenditures, poor economic performance and the rise of free market-influenced ideas have convinced governments to decentralize their operations, to induce competition within their services, to contract out to private firms operating in the market, and to privatize some functions and services entirely.[65]\n\n\nEast Province, Rwanda, created in 2006 as part of a government decentralization process\nGovernment decentralization has both political and administrative aspects. Its decentralization may be territorial, moving power from a central city to other localities, and it may be functional, moving decision-making from the top administrator of any branch of government to lower level officials, or divesting of the function entirely through privatization.[66] It has been called the \"new public management\" which has been described as decentralization, management by objectives, contracting out, competition within government and consumer orientation.[67]\n\nPolitical\nPolitical decentralization signifies a reduction in the authority of national governments over policymaking. This process is accomplished by the institution of reforms that either delegate a certain degree of meaningful decision-making autonomy to subnational tiers of government,[68] or grant citizens the right to elect lower-level officials, like local or regional representatives.[69] Depending on the country, this may require constitutional or statutory reforms, the development of new political parties, increased power for legislatures, the creation of local political units, and encouragement of advocacy groups.[38]\n\nA national government may decide to decentralize its authority and responsibilities for a variety of reasons. Decentralization reforms may occur for administrative reasons, when government officials decide that certain responsibilities and decisions would be handled best at the regional or local level. In democracies, traditionally conservative parties include political decentralization as a directive in their platforms because rightist parties tend to advocate for a decrease in the role of central government. There is also strong evidence to support the idea that government stability increases the probability of political decentralization, since instability brought on by gridlock between opposing parties in legislatures often impedes a government's overall ability to enact sweeping reforms.[68]\n\nThe rise of regional ethnic parties in the national politics of parliamentary democracies is also heavily associated with the implementation of decentralization reforms.[68] Ethnic parties may endeavor to transfer more autonomy to their respective regions, and as a partisan strategy, ruling parties within the central government may cooperate by establishing regional assemblies in order to curb the rise of ethnic parties in national elections.[68] This phenomenon famously occurred in 1999, when the United Kingdom's Labour Party appealed to Scottish constituents by creating a semi-autonomous Scottish Parliament in order to neutralize the threat from the increasingly popular Scottish National Party at the national level.[68]\n\nIn addition to increasing the administrative efficacy of government and endowing citizens with more power, there are many projected advantages to political decentralization. Individuals who take advantage of their right to elect local and regional authorities have been shown to have more positive attitudes toward politics,[70] and increased opportunities for civic decision-making through participatory democracy mechanisms like public consultations and participatory budgeting are believed to help legitimize government institutions in the eyes of marginalized groups.[71] Moreover, political decentralization is perceived as a valid means of protecting marginalized communities at a local level from the detrimental aspects of development and globalization driven by the state, like the degradation of local customs, codes, and beliefs.[72] In his 2013 book, Democracy and Political Ignorance, George Mason University law professor Ilya Somin argued that political decentralization in a federal democracy confronts the widespread issue of political ignorance by allowing citizens to engage in foot voting, or moving to other jurisdictions with more favorable laws.[73] He cites the mass migration of over one million southern-born African Americans to the North or the West to evade discriminatory Jim Crow laws in the late 19th century and early 20th century.[73]\n\nThe European Union follows the principle of subsidiarity, which holds that decision-making should be made by the most local competent authority. The EU should decide only on enumerated issues that a local or member state authority cannot address themselves. Furthermore, enforcement is exclusively the domain of member states. In Finland, the Centre Party explicitly supports decentralization. For example, government departments have been moved from the capital Helsinki to the provinces. The Centre supports substantial subsidies that limit potential economic and political centralization to Helsinki.\n\nPolitical decentralization does not come without its drawbacks. A study by Fan concludes that there is an increase in corruption and rent-seeking when there are more vertical tiers in the government, as well as when there are higher levels of subnational government employment.[74] Other studies warn of high-level politicians that may intentionally deprive regional and local authorities of power and resources when conflicts arise.[72] In order to combat these negative forces, experts believe that political decentralization should be supplemented with other conflict management mechanisms like power-sharing, particularly in regions with ethnic tensions.[71]\n\nAdministrative\nFour major forms of administrative decentralization have been described.[75][76]\n\nDeconcentration, the weakest form of decentralization, shifts responsibility for decision-making, finance and implementation of certain public functions[77] from officials of central governments to those in existing districts or, if necessary, new ones under direct control of the central government.\nDelegation passes down responsibility for decision-making, finance and implementation. It involves the creation of public-private enterprises or corporations, or of \"authorities\", special projects or service districts. All of them will have a great deal of decision-making discretion and they may be exempt from civil service requirements and may be permitted to charge users for services.\nDevolution transfers responsibility for decision-making, finance and implementation of certain public functions to the sub-national level, such as a regional, local, or state government.\nDivestment, also called privatization, may mean merely contracting out services to private companies. Or it may mean relinquishing totally all responsibility for decision-making, finance and implementation of certain public functions. Facilities will be sold off, workers transferred or fired and private companies or non-for-profit organizations allowed to provide the services.[78] Many of these functions originally were done by private individuals, companies, or associations and later taken over by the government, either directly, or by regulating out of business entities which competed with newly created government programs.[79]\nFiscal\nFiscal decentralization means decentralizing revenue raising and/or expenditure of moneys to a lower level of government while maintaining financial responsibility.[75] While this process usually is called fiscal federalism it may be relevant to unitary, federal and confederal governments. Fiscal federalism also concerns the \"vertical imbalances\" where the central government gives too much or too little money to the lower levels. It actually can be a way of increasing central government control of lower levels of government, if it is not linked to other kinds of responsibilities and authority.[80][81][82]\n\nFiscal decentralization can be achieved through user fees, user participation through monetary or labor contributions, expansion of local property or sales taxes, intergovernmental transfers of central government tax monies to local governments through transfer payments or grants, and authorization of municipal borrowing with national government loan guarantees. Transfers of money may be given conditionally with instructions or unconditionally without them.[75][83]\n\nMarket\nMarket decentralization can be done through privatization of public owned functions and businesses, as described briefly above. But it also is done through deregulation, the abolition of restrictions on businesses competing with government services, for example, postal services, schools, garbage collection. Even as private companies and corporations have worked to have such services contracted out to or privatized by them, others have worked to have these turned over to non-profit organizations or associations.[75]\n\nSince the 1970s there has been deregulation of some industries, like banking, trucking, airlines and telecommunications which resulted generally in more competition and lower prices.[citation needed] According to Cato Institute, an American libertarian think-tank, some industries deregulation of aspects of an industry were offset by more ambitious regulations elsewhere that hurt consumers, the electricity industry being a prime example.[84] For example, in banking, Cato Institute believes some deregulation allowed banks to compete across state lines, increasing consumer choice, while an actual increase in regulators and regulations forced banks to do business the way central government regulators commanded, including making loans to individuals incapable of repaying them, leading eventually to the financial crisis of 2007–2008.[85][unreliable source?]\n\nOne example of economic decentralization, which is based on a libertarian socialist model, is decentralized economic planning. Decentralized planning is a type of economic system in which decision-making is distributed amongst various economic agents or localized within production agents. An example of this method in practice is in Kerala, India which started in 1996 as, The People's Planning in Kerala.[86]\n\nSome argue that government standardisation in areas from commodity market, inspection and testing procurement bidding, Building codes, professional and vocational education, trade certification, safety, etc. are necessary.[citation needed] Emmanuelle Auriol and Michel Benaim write about the \"comparative benefits\" of decentralization versus government regulation in the setting of standards. They find that while there may be a need for public regulation if public safety is at stake, private creation of standards usually is better because \"regulators or 'experts' might misrepresent consumers' tastes and needs.\" As long as companies are averse to incompatible standards, standards will be created that satisfy needs of a modern economy.[87]\n\nEnvironmental\nCentral governments themselves may own large tracts of land and control the forest, water, mineral, wildlife and other resources they contain. They may manage them through government operations or leasing them to private businesses; or they may neglect them to be exploited by individuals or groups who defy non-enforced laws against exploitation. It also may control most private land through land-use, zoning, environmental and other regulations.[88] Selling off or leasing lands can be profitable for governments willing to relinquish control, but such programs can face public scrutiny because of fear of a loss of heritage or of environmental damage. Devolution of control to regional or local governments has been found to be an effective way of dealing with these concerns.[89][90] Such decentralization has happened in India[91] and other third world nations.[92]\n\nIdeological decentralization\nLibertarian socialism\n\nPierre Joseph Proudhon, anarchist theorist who advocated for a decentralist non-state system which he called \"federalism\"[93]\nLibertarian socialism is a political philosophy that promotes a non-hierarchical, non-bureaucratic society without private property in the means of production. Libertarian socialists believe in converting present-day private productive property into common or public goods.[94] Libertarian socialism is opposed to coercive forms of social organization. It promotes free association in place of government and opposes the social relations of capitalism, such as wage labor.[95] The term libertarian socialism is used by some socialists to differentiate their philosophy from state socialism,[96][97] and by some as a synonym for left anarchism.[98][99][100]\n\nAccordingly, libertarian socialists believe that \"the exercise of power in any institutionalized form – whether economic, political, religious, or sexual – brutalizes both the wielder of power and the one over whom it is exercised\".[101] Libertarian socialists generally place their hopes in decentralized means of direct democracy such as libertarian municipalism, citizens' assemblies, or workers' councils.[102] Libertarian socialists are strongly critical of coercive institutions, which often leads them to reject the legitimacy of the state in favor of anarchism.[103] Adherents propose achieving this through decentralization of political and economic power, usually involving the socialization of most large-scale private property and enterprise (while retaining respect for personal property). Libertarian socialism tends to deny the legitimacy of most forms of economically significant private property, viewing capitalist property relations as forms of domination that are antagonistic to individual freedom.[104][105]\n\nPolitical philosophies commonly described as libertarian socialist include most varieties of anarchism (especially anarcho-communism, anarchist collectivism, anarcho-syndicalism,[106] social anarchism and mutualism)[107] as well as autonomism, communalism, participism, libertarian Marxist philosophies such as council communism and Luxemburgism,[108] and some versions of utopian socialism[109] and individualist anarchism.[110][111][112] For Murray Bookchin \"In the modern world, anarchism first appeared as a movement of the peasantry and yeomanry against declining feudal institutions. In Germany its foremost spokesman during the Peasant Wars was Thomas Muenzer; in England, Gerrard Winstanley, a leading participant in the Digger movement. The concepts held by Muenzer and Winstanley were superbly attuned to the needs of their time – a historical period when the majority of the population lived in the countryside and when the most militant revolutionary forces came from an agrarian world. It would be painfully academic to argue whether Muenzer and Winstanley could have achieved their ideals. What is of real importance is that they spoke to their time; their anarchist concepts followed naturally from the rural society that furnished the bands of the peasant armies in Germany and the New Model in England.\"[113] The term \"anarchist\" first entered the English language in 1642, during the English Civil War, as a term of abuse, used by Royalists against their Roundhead opponents.[114] By the time of the French Revolution some, such as the Enragés, began to use the term positively,[115] in opposition to Jacobin centralisation of power, seeing \"revolutionary government\" as oxymoronic.[114] By the turn of the 19th century, the English word \"anarchism\" had lost its initial negative connotation.[114]\n\nFor Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, mutualism involved creating \"industrial democracy\", a system where workplaces would be \"handed over to democratically organised workers' associations . . . We want these associations to be models for agriculture, industry and trade, the pioneering core of that vast federation of companies and societies woven into the common cloth of the democratic social Republic.\"[116] He urged \"workers to form themselves into democratic societies, with equal conditions for all members, on pain of a relapse into feudalism.\" This would result in \"Capitalistic and proprietary exploitation, stopped everywhere, the wage system abolished, equal and just exchange guaranteed.\"[117] Workers would no longer sell their labour to a capitalist but rather work for themselves in co-operatives. Anarcho-communism calls for a confederal form in relationships of mutual aid and free association between communes as an alternative to the centralism of the nation-state. Peter Kropotkin thus suggested that \"Representative government has accomplished its historical mission; it has given a mortal blow to court-rule; and by its debates it has awakened public interest in public questions. But to see in it the government of the future socialist society is to commit a gross error. Each economic phase of life implies its own political phase; and it is impossible to touch the very basis of the present economic life-private property – without a corresponding change in the very basis of the political organization. Life already shows in which direction the change will be made. Not in increasing the powers of the State, but in resorting to free organization and free federation in all those branches which are now considered as attributes of the State.\"[118] When the First Spanish Republic was established in 1873 after the abdication of King Amadeo, the first president, Estanislao Figueras, named Francesc Pi i Margall Minister of the Interior. His acquaintance with Proudhon enabled Pi to warm relations between the Republicans and the socialists in Spain. Pi i Margall became the principal translator of Proudhon's works into Spanish[119] and later briefly became president of Spain in 1873 while being the leader of the Democratic Republican Federal Party. According to George Woodcock \"These translations were to have a profound and lasting effect on the development of Spanish anarchism after 1870, but before that time Proudhonian ideas, as interpreted by Pi, already provided much of the inspiration for the federalist movement which sprang up in the early 1860s.\"[120] According to the Encyclopædia Britannica \"During the Spanish revolution of 1873, Pi y Margall attempted to establish a decentralized, cantonalist political system on Proudhonian lines.\"[121]\n\nTo date, the best-known examples of an anarchist communist society (i.e., established around the ideas as they exist today and achieving worldwide attention and knowledge in the historical canon), are the anarchist territories during the Spanish Revolution[122] and the Free Territory during the Russian Revolution. Through the efforts and influence of the Spanish Anarchists during the Spanish Revolution within the Spanish Civil War, starting in 1936 anarchist communism existed in most of Aragon, parts of the Levante and Andalusia, as well as in the stronghold of Anarchist Catalonia before being crushed by the combined forces of the regime that won the war, Hitler, Mussolini, Spanish Communist Party repression (backed by the USSR) as well as economic and armaments blockades from the capitalist countries and the Second Spanish Republic itself.[123] During the Russian Revolution, anarchists such as Nestor Makhno worked to create and defend – through the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine – anarchist communism in the Free Territory of Ukraine from 1919 before being conquered by the Bolsheviks in 1921. Several libertarian socialists, notably Noam Chomsky among others, believe that anarchism shares much in common with certain variants of Marxism (see libertarian marxism) such as the council communism of Marxist Anton Pannekoek. In Chomsky's Notes on Anarchism,[124] he suggests the possibility \"that some form of council communism is the natural form of revolutionary socialism in an industrial society. It reflects the belief that democracy is severely limited when the industrial system is controlled by any form of autocratic elite, whether of owners, managers, and technocrats, a 'vanguard' party, or a State bureaucracy.\"[124]\n\nFree market\nUnbalanced scales.svg\nThe neutrality of this section is disputed. Relevant discussion may be found on the talk page. Please do not remove this message until conditions to do so are met. (June 2020) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)\nFree market ideas popular in the 19th century such as those of Adam Smith returned to prominence in the 1970s and 1980s. Austrian School economist Friedrich von Hayek argued that free markets themselves are decentralized systems where outcomes are produced without explicit agreement or coordination by individuals who use prices as their guide.[125] Eleanor Doyle writes that \"[e]conomic decision-making in free markets is decentralized across all the individuals dispersed in each market and is synchronized or coordinated by the price system,\" and holds that an individual right to property is part of this decentralized system.[126] Criticizing central government control, Hayek wrote in The Road to Serfdom:\n\nThere would be no difficulty about efficient control or planning were conditions so simple that a single person or board could effectively survey all the relevant facts. It is only as the factors which have to be taken into account become so numerous that it is impossible to gain a synoptic view of them that decentralization becomes imperative.[127]\n\nAccording to Bruce M. Owen, this does not mean that all firms themselves have to be equally decentralized. He writes: \"markets allocate resources through arms-length transactions among decentralized actors. Much of the time, markets work very efficiently, but there is a variety of conditions under which firms do better. Hence, goods and services are produced and sold by firms with various degrees of horizontal and vertical integration.\" Additionally, he writes that the \"economic incentive to expand horizontally or vertically is usually, but not always, compatible with the social interest in maximizing long-run consumer welfare.\" When it does not, he writes regulation may be necessary.[128]\n\nIt is often claimed that free markets and private property generate centralized monopolies and other ills; free market advocates counter with the argument that government is the source of monopoly.[129] Historian Gabriel Kolko in his book The Triumph of Conservatism argued that in the first decade of the 20th century businesses were highly decentralized and competitive, with new businesses constantly entering existing industries. In his view, there was no trend towards concentration and monopolization. While there were a wave of mergers of companies trying to corner markets, they found there was too much competition to do so. According to Kolko, this was also true in banking and finance, which saw decentralization as leading to instability as state and local banks competed with the big New York City firms. He argues that, as a result, the largest firms turned to the power of the state and worked with leaders like United States Presidents Theodore Roosevelt, William H. Taft and Woodrow Wilson to pass as \"progressive reforms\" centralizing laws like The Federal Reserve Act of 1913 that gave control of the monetary system to the wealthiest bankers; the formation of monopoly \"public utilities\" that made competition with those monopolies illegal; federal inspection of meat packers biased against small companies; extending Interstate Commerce Commission to regulating telephone companies and keeping rates high to benefit AT&T; and using the Sherman Antitrust Act against companies which might combine to threaten larger or monopoly companies.[130][131] D. T. Armentano, writing for the Cato Institute, argues that when government licensing, franchises, and other legal restrictions create monopoly and protect companies from open competition, deregulation is the solution.[132]\n\nAuthor and activist Jane Jacobs's influential 1961 book The Death and Life of American Cities criticized large-scale redevelopment projects which were part of government-planned decentralization of population and businesses to suburbs. She believed it destroyed cities' economies and impoverished remaining residents.[133] Her 1980 book The Question of Separatism: Quebec and the Struggle over Sovereignty supported secession of Quebec from Canada.[134] Her 1984 book Cities and the Wealth of Nations proposed a solution to the problems faced by cities whose economies were being ruined by centralized national governments: decentralization through the \"multiplication of sovereignties\", meaning an acceptance of the right of cities to secede from the larger nation states that were greatly limiting their ability to produce wealth.[135][136]\n\nTechnological decentralization\n\nThe Living Machine installation in the lobby of the Port of Portland headquarters which was completed and ready for occupation May 2010. The decentralized wastewater reuse system contributed to the headquarter's certification as a LEED Platinum building by the U.S. Green Building Council.\nTechnological decentralization can be defined as a shift from concentrated to distributed modes of production and consumption of goods and services.[137] Generally, such shifts are accompanied by transformations in technology and different technologies are applied for either system. Technology includes tools, materials, skills, techniques and processes by which goals are accomplished in the public and private spheres. Concepts of decentralization of technology are used throughout all types of technology, including especially information technology and appropriate technology.\n\nTechnologies often mentioned as best implemented in a decentralized manner, include: water purification, delivery and waste water disposal,[138][139] agricultural technology[140] and energy technology.[141][142] Advancing technology may allow decentralized, privatized and free market solutions for what have been public services, such utilities producing and/or delivering power, water, mail, telecommunications and services like consumer product safety, money and banking, medical licensing and detection and metering technologies for highways, parking, and auto emissions.[143][clarification needed] However, in terms of technology, a clear distinction between fully centralized or decentralized technical solutions is often not possible and therefore finding an optimal degree of centralization difficult from an infrastructure planning perspective.[144]\n\nInformation technology\nInformation technology encompasses computers and computer networks, as well as information distribution technologies such as television and telephones. The whole computer industry of computer hardware, software, electronics, internet, telecommunications equipment, e-commerce and computer services are included.[145]\n\nExecutives and managers face a constant tension between centralizing and decentralizing information technology for their organizations. They must find the right balance of centralizing which lowers costs and allows more control by upper management, and decentralizing which allows sub-units and users more control. This will depend on analysis of the specific situation. Decentralization is particularly applicable to business or management units which have a high level of independence, complicated products and customers, and technology less relevant to other units.[146]\n\nInformation technology applied to government communications with citizens, often called e-Government, is supposed to support decentralization and democratization. Various forms have been instituted in most nations worldwide.[147]\n\nThe internet is an example of an extremely decentralized network, having no owners at all (although some have argued that this is less the case in recent years[148]). \"No one is in charge of internet, and everyone is.\" As long as they follow a certain minimal number of rules, anyone can be a service provider or a user. Voluntary boards establish protocols, but cannot stop anyone from developing new ones.[149] Other examples of open source or decentralized movements are Wikis which allow users to add, modify, or delete content via the internet.[150] Wikipedia has been described as decentralized.[151] Smartphones have greatly increased the role of decentralized social network services in daily lives worldwide.[152]\n\nDecentralization continues throughout the industry, for example as the decentralized architecture of wireless routers installed in homes and offices supplement and even replace phone companies' relatively centralized long-range cell towers.[153]\n\nInspired by system and cybernetics theorists like Norbert Wiener, Marshall McLuhan and Buckminster Fuller, in the 1960s Stewart Brand started the Whole Earth Catalog and later computer networking efforts to bring Silicon Valley computer technologists and entrepreneurs together with countercultural ideas. This resulted in ideas like personal computing, virtual communities and the vision of an \"electronic frontier\" which would be a more decentralized, egalitarian and free-market libertarian society. Related ideas coming out of Silicon Valley included the free software and creative commons movements which produced visions of a \"networked information economy\".[154]\n\nBecause human interactions in cyberspace transcend physical geography, there is a necessity for new theories in legal and other rule-making systems to deal with decentralized decision-making processes in such systems. For example, what rules should apply to conduct on the global digital network and who should set them? The laws of which nations govern issues of internet transactions (like seller disclosure requirements or definitions of \"fraud\"), copyright and trademark?[155]\n\nCentralization and redecentralization of the Internet\nThe New Yorker reports that although the Internet was originally decentralized, in recent years it has become less so: \"a staggering percentage of communications flow through a small set of corporations – and thus, under the profound influence of those companies and other institutions [...] One solution, espoused by some programmers, is to make the Internet more like it used to be – less centralized and more distributed.\"[148]\n\nExamples of projects that attempt to contribute to the redecentralization of the Internet include ArkOS, Diaspora, FreedomBox, IndieWeb, Namecoin, SAFE Network, twtxt and ZeroNet as well as advocacy group Redecentralize.org, which provides support for projects that aim to make the Web less centralized.[148]\n\nIn an interview with BBC Radio 5 Live one of the co-founders of Redecentralize.org explained that:\n\n\"As we've gone on there's been more and more internet traffic focused through particular nodes such as Google or Facebook. [...] Centralised services that hold all the user data and host it themselves have become increasingly popular because that business model has worked. As the Internet has become more mass market, people are not necessarily willing or knowledgable to host it themselves, so where that hosting is outsourced it's become the default, which allows a centralization of power and a centralization of data that I think is worrying.\"[156]\n\nBlockchain technology\nSee also: Web 3.0\nBlockchain based networks are designed to support decentralization by way of a cryptographic distributed triple-entry accounting ledger, typically with \"layers\" where each layer is defined by an interoperable open protocol on top of which network participants can transact and build products or services without requiring permission from central authorities.\n\nBitcoin is the original implementation of a blockchain where proof-of-work is used as a means of establishing decentralized consensus (aka. Nakamoto consensus), thus enabling the uniqueness of its intrinsic digital asset and utility as a scarce cryptocurrency. Since a blockchain is otherwise an arbitrary data structure with no inherent decentralized properties, at present there are limited use cases, although there is active experimentation in many industries and with different methods of achieving consensus.\n\nDecentralized protocols, applications, and ledgers (used in Web 3.0[157][158]) could be more difficult for governments to control, censor, or regulate as has been seen with BitTorrent.[159][160]\n\nAppropriate technology\n\"Appropriate technology\", originally described as \"intermediate technology\" by economist E. F. Schumacher in Small Is Beautiful: A Study of Economics As If People Mattered, is generally recognized as encompassing technologies that are small-scale, decentralized, labor-intensive, energy-efficient, environmentally sound, and locally controlled.[161][better source needed]\n\nCriticism\nFactors hindering decentralization include weak local administrative or technical capacity, which may result in inefficient or ineffective services; inadequate financial resources available to perform new local responsibilities, especially in the start-up phase when they are most needed; or inequitable distribution of resources.[citation needed] Decentralization can make national policy coordination too complex; it may allow local elites to capture functions; local cooperation may be undermined by any distrust between private and public sectors; decentralization may result in higher enforcement costs and conflict for resources if there is no higher level of authority.[162] Additionally, decentralization may not be as efficient for standardized, routine, network-based services, as opposed to those that need more complicated inputs. If there is a loss of economies of scale in procurement of labor or resources, the expense of decentralization can rise, even as central governments lose control over financial resources.[75]\n\nOther challenges, and even dangers, include the possibility that corrupt local elites can capture regional or local power centers, while constituents lose representation; patronage politics will become rampant and civil servants feel compromised; further necessary decentralization can be stymied; incomplete information and hidden decision-making can occur up and down the hierarchies; centralized power centers can find reasons to frustrate decentralization and bring power back to themselves.[citation needed]\n\nIt has been noted that while decentralization may increase \"productive efficiency\" it may undermine \"allocative efficiency\" by making redistribution of wealth more difficult. Decentralization will cause greater disparities between rich and poor regions, especially during times of crisis when the national government may not be able to help regions needing it.[163]\n\nSolutions\nThe literature identifies the following eight essential preconditions that must be ensured while implementing decentralization in order to avert the \"dangers of decentralization\":[164]\n\nSocial Preparedness and Mechanisms to Prevent Elite Capture\nStrong Administrative and Technical Capacity at the Higher Levels\nStrong Political Commitment at the Higher Levels\nSustained Initiatives for Capacity-Building at the Local Level\nStrong Legal Framework for Transparency and Accountability\nTransformation of Local Government Organizations into High Performing Organizations\nAppropriate Reasons to Decentralize: Intentions Matter\nEffective Judicial System, Citizens' Oversight and Anticorruption Bodies to prevent Decentralization of Corruption",

(August 2021) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)\nNot to be confused with Stablecoin.\nThe phrase \"central bank digital currency\" (CBDC) has been used to refer to various proposals involving digital currency issued by a central bank. A report by the Bank for International Settlements states that, although the term \"central bank digital currency\" is not well-defined, \"it is envisioned by most to be a new form of central bank money [...] that is different from balances in traditional reserve or settlement accounts.\"[1]\n\nCentral bank digital currencies are also called digital fiat currencies[2] or digital base money.[3]\n\nThe present concept of CBDCs was directly inspired by Bitcoin, but a CBDC is different from virtual currency and cryptocurrency, which are not issued by a state and lack the legal tender status declared by the government.[1][4][5][6] CBDC implementations will likely not use any sort of distributed ledger such as a blockchain.[7][8]\n\nCBDCs mostly remain in the hypothetical stage, with some proof-of-concept programmes; however, more than 80% of central banks are looking at digital currencies.[9][10] China's digital RMB was the first digital currency to be issued by a major economy.[11][12]\n\n\nContents\n1\tHistory\n1.1\tBahamas\n1.2\tBrazil\n1.3\tChina\n1.4\tEcuador\n1.5\tEuropean Union/Eurozone\n1.6\tFrance and Switzerland\n1.7\tIndia\n1.8\tIran\n1.9\tNorway\n1.10\tRussia\n1.11\tSweden\n1.12\tTurkey\n1.13\tUkraine\n1.14\tUnited Kingdom\n1.15\tUnited States\n1.16\tUruguay\n1.17\tVenezuela\n2\tImplementation\n3\tCharacteristics\n4\tBenefits and impacts\n5\tRisks\n6\tReferences\nHistory\nAlthough central banks have directly released e-money previously – such as Finland's Avant stored value e-money card in the 1990s.[13] In 2000, the I LIKE Q [cs] in Czechia project was launched,[14] enabling the implementation of so-called micropayments on the Internet. For payments, users used the virtual currency Q, the fair value of which is tied to a fixed exchange rate against the Czech koruna in the ratio of 100 Q = CZK 1. The two currencies are fully convertible. The author of the project was Pepe Rafaj [cs]. Project I LIKE Q [cs] was terminated in 2003 due to an amendment to Czech law, which at that time did not provide for this form of payment. In 2021 the same group introduced project Corrency [cs] which is a type of digital currency enriched with smart contracts aka drone money.\n\nThe present concept of \"central bank digital currency\" may have been partially inspired by Bitcoin and similar blockchain-based cryptocurrencies. It is also a known concept in the field of economics, whereby the central bank enables citizens to hold accounts with it, providing a reliable and safe public savings or payments medium (\"retail\" or \"general-purpose\" CBDC).\n\nThe Bank for International Settlements (BIS) published a report in December 2020 listing the known CBDC wholesale and retail projects at that time.[15] By April 2021, there would be \"at least 80 central banks around the world that are looking at digital currencies.\"[9]\n\nAnother 2020 BIS survey found that 86% of central banks were examining the advantages and disadvantages of launching CBDCs,[16] although only 14% were in advanced stages of development (such as pilots).[17]\n\nBahamas\nOn 20 October 2020, the Central Bank of the Bahamas introduced the \"Sand Dollar\" as a digital legal currency equivalent to the traditional Bahamian dollar.[18][19][20]\n\nBrazil\nIn 2020, the Central Bank of Brazil announced plans for a digital currency by 2022, although these plans were pushed back by two or three years in 2021.[17]\n\nChina\nMain article: Digital renminbi\nSince 2014, China's central bank has been working on a project called DCEP (Digital Currency Electronic Payment).[7] The DCEP is often referred to as the \"digital yuan\" as it would be backed by the yuan.[21]\n\nAt the end of 2017, the People's Bank of China organized a number of banks and institutions to jointly develop Digital Currency Electronic Payment (DCEP) system.\n\nIn April 2020, Digital Currency Electronic Payment began to be tested in 4 Chinese big cities, including Shenzhen, Suzhou, Xiong'an, and Chengdu.[22]\n\nAfter the successful CBDC pilot, Suzhou City Municipal has signed on a Memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the New York-based third-generation blockchain startup, Cypherium. The company will help the city in the development of products within the city's ecosystem.[23][24][25][26][27]\n\nIt is aimed to have the currency in use in time for the 2022 Winter Olympics.[21]\n\nEcuador\nOne of the earliest examples of retail CBDC was in Ecuador from 2014 to 2018, when the central bank created a broadly accessible pilot retail CBDC that operated through citizens' mobile phones (it did not employ blockchain technology). The program closed in part due to low citizen adoption.[28]\n\nEuropean Union/Eurozone\nIn the Eurozone, the Bank of Spain's former governor Miguel Angel Fernandez Ordoñez has called for the introduction of a digital euro, but the European Central Bank (ECB) has so far denied such possibility.[29] Nevertheless, in December 2019, the ECB stated that \"The ECB will also continue to assess the costs and benefits of issuing a central bank digital currency (CBDC) that could ensure that the general public will remain able to use central bank money even if the use of physical cash eventually declines\".[30] On 2 October 2020 the ECB nonetheless published a report on the proposed digital euro and kickstarted a phase of experiments to consider the merits of minting such a central bank digital currency. Based on this, it will then decide whether to pursue or abandon plans to issue a digital euro toward mid-2021.[31][32][33]\n\nFrance and Switzerland\nIn June 2021, the Swiss National Bank and Bank of France launched a cross-border CBDC payments trial designed for wholesale (bank-to-bank, rather than with regular consumers) transactions. Switzerland had previously tested a digital Swiss franc for instant transactions on SIX Swiss Exchange, its premier stock exchange.[17]\n\nIndia\nIn 2017, a high level inter-ministerial committee (IMC) was formed under Department of Economic Affairs under Ministry of Finance (MoF) on governance and usage of virtual currencies in India and recommended digital form of fiat currency using Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). Department of Financial Services of MoF, Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) and Reserve Bank of India (RBI) were invited to form a special group. They were tasked to look into legal and technological development of CBDC in the country.[34] Since cryptocurrencies never met the official definition, RBI became firm on future CBDC development.[35]\n\nThe RBI on 16 December 2020 announced a regulatory sandbox to test next generation technologies on cross border payments to collect field test data and evidence of benefits and risks on the financial ecosystem.[36] On 29 January 2021, Union Government of India proposed a bill to ban trading and investments in cryptocurrencies while giving legal power to RBI to develop CBDC termed as \"programmable digital rupee\".[37] With the rapid progress in digital payment innovation, RBI now wants to move ahead with CBDC since it achieved the experience of handling scale and complexity with platforms such as Unified Payments Interface (UPI), Immediate Payment Service (IMPS) and Real-time gross settlement (RTGS) for distribution and validation purpose.[38]\n\nAs per Currency and Finance Report 2021 released by RBI, CBDC backed by the sovereign must promote non-anonymity of monetary transactions and financial inclusion by direct transfers. This is to make sure CBDC remain compliant with national and global anti-money laundering and financial-terrorism laws.[39] The RBI is planning to come out with a model of CBDC by December 2021 and will implement the national digital currency project in a phased manner. While the preliminary study will be conducted soon, RBI already started internal evaluation on scope, legal framework, calibration, technology, distribution and validation mechanism of CBDC citing increase in digital transaction during the COVID-19 pandemic.[40][41][42]\n\nThe Central Government is also planning to make amendments on The Coinage Act, 2011,[43] Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA), 1999, Information Technology Act, 2000 etc. to make room for latest technological developments concerning CBDC and its governance in the country. At the same time it is going to bring Crypto-currency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2021.[44][45]\n\nThe Department of Financial Services, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and National Health Authority introduced e-RUPI on 2 August 2021 which is a prepaid person specific, purpose specific e-voucher based on QR code or SMS string that doesn't require bank account to make it leak proof. It is going to act as a precursor by highlighting the gaps in national digital payment infrastructure that needs further improvement before the nationwide launch of CBDC.[46][47]\n\nIran\n2016-2018 interest in CBDCs in Iran was alleged by American analysts to be for the purposes of evading American sanctions.[17]\n\nNorway\nIn April 2021, after four years of research, Norway's Norges Bank announced plans to start testing technical solutions for a CBDC over the following two years.[17]\n\nRussia\n2016-2018 interest in CBDCs in Russia was alleged by American analysts to be for the purposes of evading American sanctions. In October 2020, the Central Bank of Russia published a consultation paper on a digital ruble. It aims to have a prototype ready by the end of 2021 and start pilots and trials in 2022.[17]\n\nSweden\nThe central bank of Sweden proposed an \"e-krona\" in November 2016,[13] and started testing an e-krona proof of concept in 2020.[48][49][50] The 2020 phase focused on internal simulations within Sweden's central bank; the 2021 second phase is to include transactions with outside entities, such as commercial banks.[17]\n\nTurkey\nIn January 2021, the Central Bank of Turkey announced a planned digital currency trial in the second half of 2021.[17]\n\nUkraine\nIn December 2018, the National Bank of Ukraine piloted a digital currency, the e-hryvnia, with about 5,500 tokens. It is considering how to technically advance a nationwide launch.[17]\n\nUnited Kingdom\nThe Bank of England discussed a blockchain-based central bank currency in a September 2015 speech by chief economist Andrew G. Haldane, on possible ways to implement negative interest rates.[51] A March 2016 speech by Ben Broadbent, the bank's deputy governor of monetary policy, appears to be the first use of the phrase \"central bank digital currency\", and notes direct inspiration by Bitcoin.[52][53] In April 2021, the Bank of England and HM Treasury announced a joint CBDC Taskforce to examine the possibility of a CBDC in the UK.[17]\n\nUnited States\nIn May 2021, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell announced plans to publish a discussion paper on central bank digital currency, focusing on the possibility of issuing a US CBDC. Powell believed that a potential CBDC would complement the use of cash and bank deposits rather than replacing them.[54]\n\nAlso in May 2021, the Digital Dollar Project, which is not affiliated with the United States government, planned to launch five pilot programmes, testing the potential use of a central bank digital currency in the United States of America.[55]\n\nUruguay\nIn November 2017, the central bank of Uruguay announced to begin a test to issue digital Uruguayan pesos.[56][57]\n\nVenezuela\n2016-2018 interest in CBDCs in Venezuela was alleged by American analysts to be for the purposes of evading American sanctions. To this end, Venezuela launched the blockchain-backed CBDC petro in 2018, although this project failed. Venezuela launched a digital currency—the petro—in 2018, which is purportedly backed by oil, natural gas, and mineral reserves and administered using blockchain technology. The petro has not been adopted for general use and may not truly function as a currency.[17]\n\nImplementation\nA central bank digital currency would likely be implemented using a database run by the central bank, government, or approved private-sector entities.[7][8] The database would keep a record (with appropriate privacy and cryptographic protections) of the amount of money held by every entity, such as people and corporations.\n\nIn contrast to cryptocurrencies, a central bank digital currency would be centrally controlled (even if it was on a distributed database), and so a blockchain or other distributed ledger would likely not be required or useful - even as they were the original inspiration for the concept.[7][8]\n\nResearchers propose multiple ways that a retail CBDC could be technologically implemented.[58]\n\nCharacteristics\nCBDC is a high-security digital instrument; like paper bank notes, it is a means of payment, a unit of account, and a store of value.[59] And like paper currency, each unit is uniquely identifiable to prevent counterfeit.[60]\n\nDigital fiat currency is part of the base money supply,[61] together with other forms of the currency. As such, DFC is a liability of the central bank just as physical currency is.[62] It is a digital bearer instrument that can be stored, transferred and transmitted by all kinds of digital payment systems and services. The validity of the digital fiat currency is independent of the digital payment systems storing and transferring the digital fiat currency.[63]\n\nProposals for CBDC implementation often involve the provision of universal bank accounts at the central banks for all citizens.[64][65]\n\nBenefits and impacts\nDigital fiat currency is currently being studied and tested by governments and central banks in order to realize the many positive implications it contributes to financial inclusion, economic growth, technology innovation and increased transaction efficiencies.[66][67] Here is a list of potential advantages:\n\nTechnological efficiency: instead of relying on intermediaries such as banks and clearing houses, money transfers and payments could be made in real time, directly from the payer to the payee. Being real time has a couple of major advantages:\nReduces risk: payment for goods and services often needs to be done in a timely manner and when payment verification is slow, merchants usually accept the risk of some payments not succeeding in exchange for faster service to customers. When these risks are eliminated with instant payment verifications, merchants no longer need to use intermediaries to handle the risk or to absorb the risk cost themselves.\nReduces complexity: merchants will not need to separately keep track of transactions that are slow (where the customer claims to have paid but the money has not arrived yet), therefore eliminate the waiting queue, which could simplify the transaction process from payment to rendition of goods/services.\nReduces (or eliminates) transaction fees: current payment systems like Visa, Mastercard, American Express etc. have a fee attached to each transaction and lowering or eliminating these fees could lead to widespread price drops and increased adoption of digital payments.\nFinancial inclusion: safe money accounts at the central banks could constitute a strong instrument of financial inclusion, allowing any legal resident or citizen to be provided with a free or low-cost basic bank account.\nPreventing illicit activity: A CBDC makes it feasible for a central bank to keep track of the exact location of every unit of the currency (assuming the more probable centralized, database form); tracking can be extended to cash by requiring that the banknote serial numbers used in each transaction be reported to the central bank. This tracking has a couple of major advantages:[68]\nTax collection: It makes tax avoidance and tax evasion much more difficult, since it would become impossible to use methods such as offshore banking and unreported employment to hide financial activity from the central bank or government.\nCombating crime: It makes it much easier to spot criminal activity (by observing financial activity), and thus put an end to it.[68] Furthermore, in cases where criminal activity has already occurred, tracking makes it much harder to successfully launder money, and it would often be straightforward to instantly reverse a transaction and return money to the victim of the crime.\nProof of transaction: a digital record exists to prove that money changed hands between two parties which avoids problems inherent to cash such as short-changing, cash theft and conflicting testimonies.\nProtection of money as a public utility: digital currencies issued by central banks would provide a modern alternative to physical cash – whose abolition is currently being envisaged.[69]\nSafety of payments systems: A secure and standard interoperable digital payment instrument issued and governed by a Central Bank and used as the national digital payment instruments boosts confidence in privately controlled money systems and increases trust in the entire national payment system[70][71] while also boosting competition in payment systems.\nPreservation of seigniorage income: public digital currency issuance would avoid a predictable reduction of seigniorage income for governments in the event of a disappearance of physical cash.[72]\nBanking competition: the provision of free bank accounts at the central bank offering complete safety of money deposits could strengthen competition between banks to attract bank deposits, for example by offering once again remunerated sight deposits.\nMonetary policy transmission: the issuance of central bank base money through transfers to the public could constitute a new channel for monetary policy transmission[73][74][75] (i.e. helicopter money[76]), which would allow more direct control of the money supply than indirect tools such as quantitative easing and interest rates, and possibly lead the way towards a full reserve banking system.[77] In digital Yuan trial in Shenzhen, the CBDC was programmed with an expiration date, which encouraged spending and discouraged money from sitting in a saving account. In the end, 90% of vouchers were spent in shops.[78]\nFinancial safety: CBDC would limit the practice of fractional reserve banking and potentially render deposit guarantee schemes less needed.[79]\nRisks\nDespite having potential advantages, there are also risks associated with central bank digital currencies.\n\nBanking system disintermediation: With the ability to provide digital currency directly to its citizen, one concern is that depositors would shift out of the banking system. For example, commercial banks practice fractional reserve banking while CBDCs are fully reserved. Customers may deem the safety and liquidity of CBDCs to be more attractive,[80] weakening the balance sheet position of commercial banks.[81] On the extreme, this could precipitate potential bank runs[82] and thus make banks' funding position weaker. However, the Bank of England found that if the introduction of CBDC follows a set of core principles the risk of a system-wide run from bank deposits to CBDC is addressed.[83] A central bank could also limit the demand of CBDCs by setting a ceiling on the amount of holdings.[80]\nCentralization: Since most central bank digital currencies are centralized, rather than decentralized like most cryptocurrencies, the controllers of the issuance of CBDC can add or remove money from anyone's account with a flip of a switch. In contrast, cryptocurrencies with a distributed ledger such as Bitcoin prevent this unless a group of users controlling more than 50% of mining power is in agreement.[84]\nDigital dollarization: A well-run foreign digital currency could become replacement for a local currency for the same reasons behind dollarization.[85] The announcement of Facebook's Libra contributed to the increased attention to CBDCs by central bankers,[86] as well as China's progress with DCEP to that of several Asian economies.[80]",

It was founded in 2017 and is domiciled in the Cayman Islands. Binance is currently the largest exchange in the world in terms of daily trading volume.[2]\n\nBinance was founded by Changpeng Zhao, a developer who had previously created high frequency trading software. Binance was initially based in China, but later moved its headquarters out of China due to China's increasing regulation of cryptocurrency.[citation needed]\n\nBinance is currently under investigation by both the United States Department of Justice and Internal Revenue Service on allegations of money laundering and tax offenses.[3][4][5] The UK's Financial Conduct Authority ordered Binance to stop all regulated activity in the United Kingdom in June 2021.[citation needed]\n\n\nContents\n1\tHistory\n1.1\tExchange\n1.2\tCryptocurrencies\n2\tLegal Status\n2.1\tUnited States\n2.2\tUnited Kingdom\n3\tReferences\n4\tExternal links\nHistory\nExchange\nCEO Changpeng Zhao had previously founded Fusion Systems in 2005 in Shanghai; the company built high-frequency trading systems for stockbrokers. In 2013, he joined Blockchain.info as the third member of the cryptocurrency wallet's team. He also worked at OKCoin as CTO for less than a year, a platform for spot trading between fiat and digital assets.[6]\n\nThe company was founded in China but moved its servers and headquarters out of China and into Japan in advance of the Chinese government ban on cryptocurrency trading in September 2017.[7]\n\nIn January 2018 it was the largest cryptocurrency exchange with a market capitalization of $1.3 billion,[8] a title it has retained as of April 2021, despite competition from Coinbase, among others.[9]\n\nIn March 2018, Binance announced its intentions to open an office in Malta after stricter regulations in Japan and China.[10] In April 2018, Binance signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Government of Bermuda.[11] Months later, a similar memorandum was signed with the Malta Stock Exchange to develop a platform for trading security tokens.[12] In 2019, company announced Binance Jersey, an independent entity from its parent Binance.com exchange, with the aim to expand its European influence. Jersey based exchange offers fiat-to-cryptocurrency pairs, including the Euro and the British pound.[13]\n\nIn August 2018, Binance along with three other big exchanges raised $32 million for a stablecoin project. The idea of stable coins is to provide a cryptocurrency without the notorious volatility of Bitcoin and other popular digital assets.[14]\n\nIn January 2019, Binance announced that it had partnered with Israel-based payment processor Simplex to enable cryptocurrency purchases with debit and credit cards, including Visa and Mastercard. The purchases are subject to Simplex’s local bank policies and are limited to Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Ripple’s XRP.[15]\n\nOn 7 May 2019, Binance revealed that it had been the victim of a “large scale security breach” in which hackers had stolen 7,000 Bitcoin worth around U.S.$40 million at the time.[16] Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao said the hackers “used a variety of techniques, including phishing, viruses and other attacks” and structured their transaction “in a way that passed our existing security checks.”[17] Binance halted further withdrawals and deposits but allowed trading to continue. The site pledged to reimburse customers through its \"Secure Asset Fund for Users (SAFU)\".[18][19] Withdrawals resumed by 19 May.[20]\n\nIn September 2019, the exchange began offering perpetual futures contracts, allowing leverage as high as 125 times the value of the contracts.[21] In November 2019, Binance acquired Indian bitcoin exchange WazirX.[22]\n\nOn 21 February 2020, the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA) issued a public statement responding to media reports referring to Binance as a 'Malta-based' cryptocurrency company. The statement noted that Binance \"is not authorized by the MFSA to operate in the cryptocurrency sphere and is therefore not subject to regulatory oversight by the MFSA.\" The MFSA added that it was \"assessing if Binance has any activities in Malta which may not fall within the realm of regulatory oversight.\"[23]\n\nOn 28 October 2020, Forbes staff released leaked documents alleging that Binance and Changpeng Zhao created an elaborate corporate structure designed to intentionally deceive United States regulators and secretly profit from cryptocurrency investors located in the country.[1] Binance officially blocks access from IP addresses located in the United States, but \"potential customers would be taught how to evade geographic restrictions\", Forbes claimed.[1]\n\nIn May 2021 it was reported that Binance was under investigation by both the Internal Revenue Service and the United States Department of Justice on allegations of money laundering and tax offenses.[24][25][26]\n\nCryptocurrencies\nThroughout its history, the company has launched two cryptocurrencies which it developed itself: Binance Coin (BNB),[27] launched June 2017,[28] and Binance Smart Chain,[29] launched September 2020.[30] Binance Smart Chain operates using \"Proof of Staked Authority\", a combination of proof of stake and proof of authority. It currently has 21 approved validators. As of 2021, Binance Coin was the cryptocurrency with the third highest market capitalization.[27] Binance allows its users to pay fees on its exchange with Binance Coin.[27][31]\n\nIn April 2021 the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority in Germany warned that the company risked fines for offering its securities-tracking digital tokens without publishing an investor prospectus.[32]\n\nLegal Status\nUnited States\nIn 2019, Binance was banned in the United States on regulatory grounds. In response, Binance and other investors opened Binance.US, a separate exchange registered with the United States Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and designed to comply with all applicable US laws.[33] The US variant has been praised for offering a very similar interface and feature set to its worldwide counterpart. However, it is currently banned in seven states.[34] In May 2021, Bloomberg News reported that Binance was under investigation by the United States Department of Justice and Internal Revenue Service for money-laundering and tax evasion.[35]\n\nUnited Kingdom\nIn June 2021, Binance was ordered by the UK's Financial Conduct Authority to stop all regulated activity in the United Kingdom.[36][37] In January 2021, the FCA began requiring firms dealing with cryptocurrency to register in order to comply with anti-money laundering rules. As Binance is not compliant with these rules, it is being forced to cease operations within the coming weeks.",

(November 2020)\nA cryptocurrency exchange, or a digital currency exchange (DCE), is a business that allows customers to trade cryptocurrencies or digital currencies for other assets, such as conventional fiat money or other digital currencies. Exchanges may accept credit card payments, wire transfers or other forms of payment in exchange for digital currencies or cryptocurrencies. A cryptocurrency exchange can be a market maker that typically takes the bid–ask spreads as a transaction commission for is service or, as a matching platform, simply charges fees.\n\nSome brokerages which also focus on other assets such as stocks, like Robinhood and eToro, let users purchase but not withdraw cryptocurrencies to cryptocurrency wallets. Dedicated cryptocurrency exchanges such as Binance and Coinbase do allow cryptocurrency withdrawals, however.\n\n\nContents\n1\tOperation\n2\tHistory\n2.1\tEarly history\n2.2\t2014 to present\n3\tExamples\n4\tLegislation\n5\tSee also\n6\tReferences\n7\tFurther reading\nOperation\nThe exchanges can send cryptocurrency to a user's personal cryptocurrency wallet. Some can convert digital currency balances into anonymous prepaid cards which can be used to withdraw funds from ATMs worldwide[1][2] while other digital currencies are backed by real-world commodities such as gold.[3]\n\nThe creators of digital currencies are often independent of the digital currency exchange that facilitate trading in the currency.[2] In one type of system, digital currency providers (DCP) are businesses that keep and administer accounts for their customers, but generally do not issue digital currency to those customers directly.[4][5] Customers buy or sell digital currency from digital currency exchanges, who transfer the digital currency into or out of the customer's DCP account.[5] Some exchanges are subsidiaries of DCP, but many are legally independent businesses.[4] The denomination of funds kept in DCP accounts may be of a real or fictitious currency.[5]\n\nA digital currency exchange can be a brick-and-mortar business or a strictly online business. As a brick-and-mortar business, it exchanges traditional payment methods and digital currencies. As an online business, it exchanges electronically transferred money and digital currencies.[4]\n\nOften, the digital currency exchanges operate outside the Western countries to avoid regulation and prosecution. However, they do handle Western fiat currencies and maintain bank accounts in several countries to facilitate deposits in various national currencies.[1][2]\n\nDecentralized exchanges such as Etherdelta, IDEX and HADAX do not store users' funds on the exchange, but instead facilitate peer-to-peer cryptocurrency trading. Decentralized exchanges are resistant to security problems that affect other exchanges, but as of mid 2018 suffer from low trading volumes.[6]\n\nHistory\nEarly history\nIn 2004 three Australian-based digital currency exchange businesses voluntarily shut down following an investigation by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC). The ASIC viewed the services offered as legally requiring an Australian Financial Services License, which the companies lacked.[7]\n\nIn 2006, U.S.-based digital currency exchange business Gold Age Inc., a New York state business, was shut down by the U.S. Secret Service after operating since 2002.[8] Business operators Arthur Budovsky and Vladimir Kats were indicted \"on charges of operating an illegal digital currency exchange and money transmittal business\" from their apartments, transmitting more than $30 million to digital currency accounts.[5] Customers provided limited identity documentation, and could transfer funds to anyone worldwide, with fees sometimes exceeding $100,000.[5] Budovsky and Kats were sentenced in 2007 to five years in prison \"for engaging in the business of transmitting money without a license, a felony violation of state banking law\", ultimately receiving sentences of five years' probation.[9]\n\nIn April 2007, the U.S. government ordered E-Gold administration to lock/block approximately 58 E-Gold accounts owned and used by The Bullion Exchange, AnyGoldNow, IceGold, GitGold, The Denver Gold Exchange, GoldPouch Express, 1MDC (a Digital Gold Currency, based on e-gold) and others, forcing G&SR (owner of OmniPay) to liquidate the seized assets.\n\nA few weeks later, E-Gold faced four indictments.[10]\n\nIn July 2008, WebMoney changed its rules, affecting many exchanges. Since that time it became prohibited[by whom?] to exchange WebMoney to the most popular e-currencies like E-gold, Liberty Reserve and others.\n\nAlso in July 2008 E-gold's three directors accepted a bargain with the prosecutors and plead guilty to one count of \"conspiracy to engage in money laundering\" and one count of the \"operation of an unlicensed money transmitting business\".[11] E-gold ceased operations in 2009.\n\nIn 2013, Jean-Loup Richet, a research fellow at ESSEC ISIS, surveyed new money laundering techniques that cybercriminals were using in a report written for the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.[12] A common approach to cyber money laundering was to use a digital currency exchanger service which converted dollars into Liberty Reserve and could be sent and received anonymously. The receiver could convert the Liberty Reserve currency back into cash for a small fee. In May 2013, digital currency exchanger Liberty Reserve was shut down after the alleged founder, Arthur Budovsky Belanchuk, and four others were arrested in Costa Rica, Spain, and New York \"under charges for conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy and operation of an unlicensed money transmitting business.\"[13] Budovsky, a former U.S. citizen and naturalized Costa Rican, was convicted in connection with the 2006 Gold Age raid.[9] More than $40 million in assets were placed under restraint pending forfeiture, and more than 30 Liberty Reserve exchanger domain names were seized.[13][14] The company was estimated to have laundered $6 billion in criminal proceeds.[13]\n\n2014 to present\nFollowing the launch of a decentralized cryptocurrency bitcoin in 2008 and the subsequent introduction of other cryptocurrencies, many virtual platforms were created specifically for the exchange of decentralized cryptocurrencies. Their regulation differs from country to country.\n\nIn February 2014, Mt. Gox, the largest cryptocurrency exchange at the time, suspended trading, closed its website and exchange service, and filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan from creditors.[15][16] In April 2014, the company began liquidation proceedings.[17] This was the result of a large theft of bitcoins that were stolen straight out of the Mt. Gox hot wallet over time, beginning in late 2011.[18][19]\n\nExamples\nIn early 2018, Bloomberg News reported the largest cryptocurrency exchanges based on the volume and estimated revenues data collected by CoinMarketCap.[20] Similar statistics was reported on Statista in a survey by Encrybit to understand cryptocurrency exchange problems. According to the survey, the top three cryptocurrency exchanges are Binance, Huobi, and OKEX. Other data points in the survey included the problems that cryptocurrency traders experience with cryptocurrency exchanges and the expectation of traders. Security and high trading fees are the top concerns.[21][22] The exchanges are all fairly new and privately held. Several do not report basic information such as the names of the owners, financial data, or even the location of the business.[23]\n\nBinance\nBitfinex\nBithumb\nBitstamp\nCoinbase\nHuobi\nKraken\nOKEx\nUpbit\nLegislation\nSee also: legality of bitcoin by country or territory\nBy 2016, several cryptocurrency exchanges operating in the European Union obtained licenses under the EU Payment Services Directive and the EU Electronic Money Directive.[24] The adequacy of such licenses for the operation of a cryptocurrency exchange has not been judicially tested. The European Council and the European Parliament announced that they will issue regulations to impose stricter rules targeting exchange platforms.\n\nIn 2018, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission maintained that \"if a platform offers trading of digital assets that are securities and operates as an \"exchange,\" as defined by the federal securities laws, then the platform must register with the SEC as a national securities exchange or be exempt from registration\".[25] The Commodity Futures Trading Commission now permits the trading of cryptocurrency derivatives publicly.[26]\n\nAmong the Asian countries, Japan is more forthcoming and regulations mandate the need for a special license from the Financial Services Authority to operate a cryptocurrency exchange.[27] China and Korea remain hostile, with China banning bitcoin miners and freezing bank accounts.[28][29] While Australia is yet to announce its conclusive regulations on cryptocurrency, it does require its citizens to disclose their digital assets for capital gains tax.[30]",

A DApp can have frontend code and user interfaces written in any language that can make calls to its backend. Furthermore, its frontend can be hosted on decentralized storage such as Swarm[when defined as?] or IPFS.\n\nDApps are typically open-source, decentralized, incentivized through providing tokens to those who validate the DApp, and in compliance with a specific protocol agreed upon within the community.\n\nDApps may run on top of distributed computing systems such as Ethereum or Bitcoin. Decentralized applications are stored on and executed by a blockchain system.\n\nAdoption\nFrom finance to gaming and even online gambling, DApps can be applied to several online industries.\n\nA list of DApps can be found on various cryptocurrency data analytics platforms including State of the DApps, Dapp.com, Holdex, DAppRadar, CoinGecko, and Live Coin Watch.\n\nThe Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers hosted conferences on DApps in 2019 and 2020.[2]\n\nDeFi DApps\nDApps have been utilized in decentralized finance (DeFi), which revolves around dapps that perform financial functions on blockchains, a technology that was invented for Bitcoin but has since caught on more broadly.[4]\n\nDeFi DApps allow users to:\n\nLend or borrow funds from others.\nGo long or short on a range of assets.\nTrade coins or earn interest in a savings-like account without a centralized intermediary.[5]\nDApp Browsers\nAll the DApps have a unique code that may only work on a specific platform. Not all DApps work on traditional browsers like Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge. Some of them only work on special websites with a customized code, adjusted to open certain DApps.\n\nGambling Dapps\nOnline gambling is another industry with many popular Dapps, and the potential to grow even further. [6]\n\nAmong their many advantages, gambling Dapps allow for faster and smoother transactions, low-cost casino operations that result in a lower house edge for the user, more anonymity, and provable fairness. [7]\n\nCriticisms\nThere have been criticisms of DApps surrounding their inaccessibility to the average user.[full citation needed]\n\nMany DApps struggle to attract users, particularly in their founding stages, and even those that attract widespread initial popularity struggle to retain it.[full citation needed][needs update]\n\nA notable example was the DApp CryptoKitties, which crashed the Ethereum network at the height of its popularity.[8] CryptoKitties and another similar gaming-based DApp, Dice Games, have failed to attract similar traction since.[9][needs update]",

          "context": "What is Stellar?\nAvatar\nJuly 16, 2021 12:53\nWhat is Stellar?\n\nStellar is an open-source, decentralized payment protocol that allows for fast, cross-border transactions between any pair of currencies. Like other cryptocurrencies, it operates using blockchain technology. Its native asset, a digital currency, is called lumen (XLM). XLM powers the Stellar network and all of its operations, similarly to how ether (ETH) powers the Ethereum network.\n\nHow does Stellar’s blockchain work?\n\nTransactions that take place on the Stellar network are added to a shared, distributed, public ledger, a database accessible by anyone worldwide. In order to reach consensus on transactions so quickly and accurately, Stellar uses its own unique consensus method.\n\nHow does Stellar’s consensus method work?\n\nStellar’s consensus method allows for fast and cheap transactions, with everyone on the network reaching agreement about transaction validity within a few seconds. Every participant (called a node) who helps add Stellar transactions to the global ledger chooses its own mini-network of other trusted participants that it agrees with. As long as these mini-networks (called quorum slices) overlap, the overall Stellar network can reach agreement about which transactions are valid and can be added to the ledger very quickly. You can read about how Stellar’s consensus mechanism works in greater detail in this article.\n\nWhere is the value of Stellar derived from?\n\nStellar is useful and valuable because it is a global exchange network, capable of hosting thousands of exchanges between currencies and tokens per second. Exchanging between cryptocurrencies and/or fiat currencies can be a lengthy and expensive process; Stellar makes exchanging swift and cheap. XLM, the asset that will be supported within the Blockchain.com Wallet, is used to pay transaction fees and maintain accounts on the Stellar network.\n\n\n\n\nStellar glossary\nAvatar\nSeptember 04, 2020 20:19\nAccount\n\nAn account, otherwise known as an address, is used to store your funds and send and receive payments. Every account has a public key and a secret, private key. Learn more about public and private keys here.\n\nAirdrop\n\nAn airdrop, also sometimes called a giveaway, is a free distribution (usually on a large scale) of a cryptocurrency token or coin to a deterministic set of users. This article goes into greater detail.\n\nAnchor\n\nAnchors are entities on the Stellar network that users trust to hold their funds and issue credits in return for deposits. All non-XLM transactions on the Stellar network pass through anchors, who act as a bridge between other currencies (including fiat) and the Stellar network.\n\nConsensus\n\nStellar uses a different protocol than the other cryptocurrencies supported by the Blockchain wallet for determining the validity of transactions and adding them to the global ledger, called consensus. Every participant (called a node) who helps add Stellar transactions to the global ledger chooses its own mini-network of other trusted participants that it agrees with. As long as these mini-networks (called quorum slices) overlap, the overall Stellar network can reach agreement about which transactions are valid and can be added to the ledger very quickly. You can read about how Stellar’s consensus mechanism works in greater detail in this article.\n\nFederation\n\nShort for Stellar federation protocol, Federation is an optional aspect of Stellar that maps addresses to more information about a user. Unlike regular cryptocurrency addresses, which are long strings of alphanumeric characters, Federation addresses look rather like email addresses. The Blockchain wallet does not support Federation addresses at this time.\n\nLedger\n\nWhere Bitcoin has blocks, Stellar has ledgers. A Stellar ledger represents the state of the network at any given point in time, and is comprised of accounts and balances, orders in the distributed exchange, and any other data that may have been included with transactions. The very first ledger in the history of the network was called the genesis ledger, and all of the ledgers together make up a chain of ledgers, each cryptographically linked to the one before it.\n\nLumen\n\nThe lumen (pl. lumens, also XLM) is the native asset of Stellar. It is the cryptocurrency that powers the Stellar network and decentralized exchange. Blockchain.com users can send, receive, exchange, and store XLM within their web or hardware wallets.\n\nMemo\n\nA memo is a message included with a transaction. This optional feature of Stellar allows users to communicate with each other on the global public ledger. Learn more about memos here.\n\nNode\n\nAny computer that is connected to the network is called a node. A full node is one that keeps the entire history of the network and verifies the network rules, checking every transaction and ledger against the rules of consensus. Those interested in a more technical explanation and description of different types of Stellar nodes can find it here.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the difference between Stellar and lumens?\nAvatar\nSeptember 03, 2020 00:38\nStellar can be confusing to new users because its terminology is very different from other supported cryptocurrencies in the Blockchain Wallet. While other assets share their names with their respective networks (e.g. Bitcoin, the network, and bitcoin, the cryptocurrency), Stellar’s native asset has a completely different name: lumen (plural lumens), or XLM.\n\nThese terms are not interchangeable. Stellar refers only to the network as a whole, to the protocol, and to the system and community. Lumens (XLM) is the currency that powers the network, which users can send and receive, and use to carry out exchanges between other currencies.\n\n\n\nWhy do Stellar addresses have a minimum balance requirement?\nAvatar\nAugust 09, 2021 04:23\nAll Stellar addresses are required to keep a minimum balance of XLM at all times. The current minimum is 1 XLM, which is set by the Stellar network. The minimum balance requirement is in place in order to prevent people from overwhelming the network and to aid in prioritization. The first use of a new Stellar address must be to receive at least 1 XLM. This will activate the address and allow it to be used in further transactions on the network. You will never be able to send your entire balance from your Stellar address. That 1 XLM minimum will always have to be kept as a balance.\n\n\nStellar transaction fees\nAvatar\nSeptember 03, 2020 00:41\nLike Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Bitcoin Cash, Stellar transactions involve fees. What’s different is how Stellar fees are determined, and how they are used. For each operation in a Stellar transaction, there is a base fee, which is a standard set by the network. The fee acts as a deterrent, ensuring that malicious actors cannot spam the network in a denial of service (DoS) attack.\n\nThe base fee per operation is currently set to .00001 XLM. The more operations your transaction includes, the higher your fee will be. For example, if all you’re doing is sending XLM from one address to another, your fee will be .00001 XLM. However, if your transaction was more complex, like an exchange between currencies, then a higher fee would be required.\n\nSince Stellar does not rely on mining to add transactions to the global ledger, transaction fees are pooled and then redistributed in the form of inflation. In Stellar’s protocol, new lumens (XLM) are added to the network at a rate of 1% each year via a built-in, fixed inflation mechanism. The inflation funds are sent to an address chosen by the network to receive it each week. You can learn more about inflation here.\n\nWas this article helpful?\n \n\n\nStellar consensus\nAvatar\nJune 23, 2021 15:57\nStellar has four key aspects when it comes to adding transactions to the ledger, or blockchain:\n\nFreedom of participation: anyone can join the consensus process and no one has all or a majority of the decision-making power\nLow latency: Fast and cheap transactions that are confirmed within a few seconds\nFreedom of trust: nodes (those participating in the consensus system) choose their own set of trusted nodes and can revoke trust from bad actors at any time\nSafety: even if nodes fail or bad actors join the network, consensus can still be reached and the network will come to the right conclusion\nThe above aspects of Stellar’s consensus system are a proposed solution to a consensus dilemma called the Byzantine Generals’ Problem (BGP). The problem describes a scenario where a large Byzantine army is attempting to conquer a resistant city and must collectively decide to attack or retreat. Because of its size, the army is led by many generals who must coordinate through messengers. The problem is rooted in communication failures and the trustworthiness of generals and messengers, some of whom may be traitors. Resolving the BGP dilemma requires Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT), which is when all trustworthy generals reach the same conclusion, despite a small number of traitors and failures. In other words, consensus in a distributed system (like a blockchain, or the Byzantine army analogy) can be met with BFT, a failsafe method that endures activity from bad actors.\n\nDifferent from BFT, Stellar’s consensus mechanism is a type of Federated Byzantine Agreement (FBA) referred to as the Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP). On the Stellar network, faults come in the form of faulty or malicious nodes. Stellar can provide safety (or a guarantee that nothing undesirable, such as a fork of the network, will ever happen) because participants in its system can continue to vote for their desired outcome until consensus is reached. If there is ever a discrepancy - if a quorum (the set of nodes sufficient to reach consensus) can’t agree on what should be put in the ledger - then the entire network will cease operations until consensus is reached.\n\nThis kind of outcome is rare because of the way that nodes are able to choose a set with other, trusted nodes to belong to. This subset of trusted nodes is called a quorum slice, a small piece of the overall quorum that must reach agreement in order to close the ledger (i.e. add a block of transactions to the global ledger). Individual trusted nodes will convince each other of agreement within a quorum slice. As long as quorum slices intersect with each other, the overall network can reach consensus very quickly.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn order for distributed systems like blockchains to be secure and to scale, safeguards (like the Stellar Consensus Protocol) must be in place to sustain potential failures and attacks by bad actors. Stellar’s own consensus protocol is a type of Federated Byzantine Agreement, which is what allows the network to avoid the BGP dilemma and operate according to its four properties described above.\n\n\n\nWhat is Algorand?\nAvatar\nFebruary 08, 2021 13:34\nAlgorand is a public cryptocurrency blockchain and protocol that aims to deliver decentralization, scale, and security for all participants. Its native currency is ALGO. Algorand uses a permissionless proof-of-stake protocol: all users who hold ALGOs are automatically eligible to participate in all functionalities of the protocol, including participating in consensus by proposing and voting on blocks, in proportion to their stake (how much ALGO they have). \n\nOther distinguishing factors that Algorand delivers include fast transaction processing, low-cost and decentralized consensus, and no forks. Interested in learning more about Algorand? Additional information about the Algorand protocol can be found on their website.\n\n\n\n\nWhat can I do with ALGO?\nAvatar\nApril 01, 2021 16:00\nBlockchain.com Wallet users can now buy ALGO tokens (the native asset of the Algorand network and protocol) in the Buy Crypto section of their wallets.\n\nWhen you buy ALGO in your Blockchain.com Wallet, your purchase is settled in your custodial Trading Account balance, securely stored for you by Blockchain.com.\n\nAt this time, we don’t yet support withdrawing ALGO from the Trading Account, although we're working to add this functionality soon. In the meantime, you can store the ALGO in your Trading Account, Swap your ALGO for any other asset supported by the Wallet, or sell your ALGO.\n\nValidating and voting on blocks and other staking activities are currently not supported, but are planned to be in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "context": "\"What is Ethereum?\" and other answers to basic questions about the Ethereum network\nAvatar\nAugust 14, 2021 17:25\nWhat is Ethereum?\nEthereum is a distributed public blockchain network that focuses on running the programming code of any decentralized application. More simply, it is a platform for sharing information across the globe that cannot be manipulated or changed.\nHow is it different than bitcoin?\nBitcoin was a pioneer in the blockchain revolution by establishing a public, permissionless, distributed ledger system to validate, store, and replicate transaction data on computers all over the world. Ethereum expands these concepts by harnessing that same block chain capability for computer code. While Bitcoin offers one particular application of block chain technology, a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, Ethereum allows for scripts of code to be run as a global computational network. This concept has a wide range of potential applications such as voting, global supply chains, medical records, the financial system -- the opportunities are endless.\nWhat is ether?\nEther is a decentralized digital currency, also known as ETH. In addition to being a tradeable cryptocurrency, ether powers the Ethereum network by paying for transaction fees and computational services. Ether is paving the way for a more intelligent financial platform.\nWhy is this interesting and valuable for me to be involved in? \nYou asked -- we listened! Many of our users have expressed interest in expanding their access to other digital currencies. The addition of ether as a new currency in our wallet enables you and millions around the globe to transact, save, and hedge their way to a better financial future.\nWhere is the value in Ethereum derived from?\nEthereum is useful and valuable because of its ability to have a wide variety of intelligent applications built on top of it, including anything from financial contracts to voting and governance applications. Today, the authentication for these processes can take days or even weeks. With Ethereum, verification is almost instant. As the platform grows, it could continue to change the way we do business and transact on a daily basis. We want to give you the opportunity to start using ether on the Ethereum blockchain now, so you'll be ready for what the future brings.\n\n\nWhat are the fees for sending ether?\nAvatar\nApril 03, 2021 03:26\nWhile our wallet is entirely free to use, the small fee included in your transaction goes to the miners, who help power the flow of transactions on the Ethereum network. To ensure your transactions confirm consistently and reliably, our wallet will automatically include an appropriate fee based on the level of network traffic at the time. \n\n\n\nWhat are the fees for sending ether?\nAvatar\nApril 03, 2021 03:26\nWhile our wallet is entirely free to use, the small fee included in your transaction goes to the miners, who help power the flow of transactions on the Ethereum network. To ensure your transactions confirm consistently and reliably, our wallet will automatically include an appropriate fee based on the level of network traffic at the time. \n\n\nHow do I know a transaction has been successfully received/sent?\nAvatar\nJuly 16, 2021 11:59\nTransactions will appear almost instantly in your transaction feed, which you can find in your ether dashboard. Your ether transaction will be considered complete once it has 12 confirmations. This typically takes about 5 minutes, but times can vary. Until then your transaction will show up as pending.\n\n\n\nWhat is an ERC20 token?\nAvatar\nJuly 23, 2021 22:03\nWhat is an ERC20 token?\nAn ERC20 token is a blockchain-based asset with similar functionality to bitcoin, ether, and bitcoin cash: it can hold value and be sent and received.\nThe major difference between ERC20 tokens and other cryptocurrencies is that ERC20 tokens are created and hosted on the Ethereum blockchain, whereas bitcoin and bitcoin cash are the native currencies of their respective blockchains.\nERC20 tokens are stored and sent using ethereum addresses and transactions, and use gas to cover transaction fees.\nWhy ERC20?\nERC20 is an official protocol for proposing improvements to the Ethereum (ETH) network. ERC stands for Ethereum Request for Comment, and 20 is the proposal identifier. This is a common standard for creating tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.\nThis token standard defines a set of rules that apply to all ERC20 tokens that allow them to interact seamlessly with one another.\nWallets and exchanges use the standard to integrate various ERC20 tokens onto their platforms and facilitate exchanges between ERC20 tokens and other cryptocurrencies.\n\n\n\nWhat is gas?\nAvatar\nAugust 14, 2021 17:21\nWhat is gas?\n\nA gas unit is the smallest type of work that is processed on the Ethereum network.\nValidating and confirming transactions on the Ethereum blockchain requires a certain amount of gas, depending on the size and type of each transaction.\nGas measures the amount of work miners need to do in order to include transactions in a block.\nHow does gas affect transaction confirmation?\n\nMiners are paid for their work validating transactions and adding blocks to the Ethereum blockchain in fractions of ether (ETH). These fractional units are called gwei, and comprise the gas price for the transaction.\nIf a transaction needs to be confirmed urgently or as soon as possible, a higher gas price should be included with the transaction.\nIt is important to communicate to the miners how much work needs to be done in order to process a transaction. This is done with the gas limit, which the Blockchain.com Wallet calculates automatically to ensure that transactions go through successfully. The limit also prevents overspending on mining fees.\nIf the gas limit is set too low, a transaction can fail, or get rejected, which would result in losing the gas paid for the transaction. If a transaction is processed before the limit is reached, the rest of the gas will be returned to the sending wallet.\n\n\n\nHow do I backup my ether wallet? Is my ether backed up with my bitcoin? Do I need to do any other backup / security steps?\nAvatar\nJanuary 29, 2021 09:49\nIf you’ve written down and stored your wallet’s backup phrase, you’re good to go! Your ether private key and funds are already stored in your 12-word mnemonic phrase.\n\nIf you haven’t yet backed up your wallet, head over to the Security section of your wallet to do it now. Your backup phrase acts as a failsafe, ensuring that you can always access your funds. This guide can walk you through the process.\n\n\n\nWhat is Tether (USDT)?\nAvatar\nMay 28, 2021 16:23\nTether (USDT) is a popular stablecoin whose value is pegged to the U.S. dollar. Tether protects users from the volatility of the cryptocurrency space by fixing the value of its cryptocurrency to the value of an established fiat currency. All USDT tokens are 100% backed by Tether’s reserves.\n\nAlthough the original implementation of USDT was built over the bitcoin blockchain, there have been other implementations since then, including an ERC-20 version hosted on the Ethereum blockchain, which can be used in smart contracts or decentralized applications. The Blockchain.com Wallet supports the ERC-20 implementation.\n\n\n\nWhy do I need ETH to send USDT?\nAvatar\nAugust 09, 2021 16:16\nUSDT (Tether) is an ERC20 token. This means its transactions occur on the Ethereum blockchain, which requires that the sender pay a fee in ETH to ensure their transaction confirms. Learn more about ETH fees here.\n\nYou will need a small amount of ETH in order to Swap your USDT for any other cryptocurrency within the Blockchain.com Wallet, or to send it externally to a third-party exchange or platform. However, you do not need to keep an ETH balance in order to receive or to store USDT in your Wallet. If you don’t have enough ETH to use your USDT, you can Swap for it from another cryptocurrency or receive it from another exchange or platform.\n\n\n\n\nCan I receive bitcoin-based USDT to my Blockchain.com Wallet?\nAvatar\nAugust 12, 2021 09:35\nNo. We strongly encourage our users to double-check their addresses before receiving cryptocurrency to their Blockchain.com Wallets to confirm that they are using the proper address for the correct currency and that the token they are receiving is supported. The Blockchain.com Wallet only supports the ERC-20 implementation of USDT. All other implementations are not supported.\n\nTo receive USDT to your Blockchain.com Wallet, it must be sent to your ethereum address. We offer a step-by-step guide to receiving USDT to your Wallet here.\n\nPlease note that, if any unsupported cryptocurrency is sent to your Blockchain.com Wallet, it will not show up in your balances and activity, and you will not be able to use the tokens within your Blockchain.com Wallet. You can find a full list of our supported currencies here.\n\n\n\n\nCan I still receive USD Digital into my Blockchain.com Wallet?\nAvatar\nJuly 26, 2021 16:27\nYes. Paxos Standard is what the USD-D token is now called in the Blockchain.com Wallet. The process to receive this ERC20 token has not changed. You can receive USD-D from a third party wallet or exchange to your Blockchain.com Wallet, and it will show up in your Paxos Standard (PAX) balance. For step-by-step instructions on how to receive Paxos Standard, click here. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nUSD Digital is now Paxos Standard\nAvatar\nYesterday at 11:11\nBeginning today, USD Digital will be referred to as Paxos Standard (PAX for short) within your Blockchain.com Wallet. As before, PAX always maintains a consistent 1:1 value relationship with the US dollar. This means that 1 Paxos Standard token will always be valued at 1 USD within your Wallet.\n\nAside from this change, nothing else about your Blockchain.com Wallet experience with this token will be different. To learn more about Paxos Standard, click here.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is Paxos Standard (previously USD Digital)?\nAvatar\nAugust 16, 2021 23:59\nPaxos Standard (represented in the Wallet as PAX) is an ERC-20 token known as a stablecoin and is fully supported in the Blockchain.com Wallet. \n\nA Paxos Standard token is not itself a US dollar, but Paxos Trust Company, LLC is responsible for backing each token with a US dollar held in segregated accounts at FDIC-insured, U.S. banks. Paxos Trust Company, LLC is also responsible for issuing and redeeming each token in exchange for $1.00 USD. \n\nIn general, a stablecoin is a cryptocurrency asset designed to minimize the price volatility typically associated with cryptocurrencies. To that end, a stablecoin will typically be pegged to another asset or group of assets, such as another currency or commodity.\n\nHolding Paxos Standard in your Wallet means that you can easily transition between volatile cryptocurrencies and a token pegged to USD. While the fiat estimation of your other cryptocurrency balances will change with the market, the value of your Paxos Standard balance will always remain the same, and change only with transactions that add to or subtract from your Paxos balance.\n\nSince Paxos Standard is an ERC20 token (read more about these here), any transactions with it will cost an additional, small fee in ETH. You can learn more about Paxos Standard transaction fees and the ETH minimum balance here.\n\n\n\n\nWhy do I need ETH to send Paxos Standard (previously USD Digital)?\nAvatar\nAugust 14, 2021 17:19\nPaxos Standard is an ERC20 token. This means its transactions occur on the Ethereum blockchain, which require that the sender pay a fee in ETH to ensure their transaction confirms. Learn more about ETH fees here.\n\nYou will need a small amount of ETH in order to Swap your Paxos Standard for any other cryptocurrency within the Blockchain.com Wallet, or to send it externally to a third-party exchange or platform. However, you do not need to keep an ETH balance in order to receive or to store Paxos Standard in your Wallet. If you don’t have enough ETH to use your Paxos Standard, you can Swap for it from another cryptocurrency or receive it from another exchange or platform.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs my Paxos Standard (previously USD Digital) balance backed up by my backup phrase?\nAvatar\nJuly 26, 2021 16:26\nYes! If you’ve written down and stored your wallet’s 12-word backup phrase, you’re good to go. Because Paxos Standard is an ERC20 token, you will receive it to your regular ethereum address. The private key of your ethereum address is what grants you ownership of your Paxos Standard balance, along with your ether.\n\nIf you haven’t yet backed up your wallet, head over to the Security section of your wallet to do it now. Your backup phrase acts as a failsafe, ensuring that you can always access your funds. This guide can walk you through the process.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is wrapped-DGLD (wDGLD)?\nAvatar\nJune 08, 2021 22:06\n \n\nLast year we partnered with Coinshares to launch DGLD, a digital asset representing allocated physical gold stored in a Swiss vault. A common request from avid investors was more ways to get access and use DGLD, and to give users the option to store DGLD wherever they store their other crypto.\n\nWe’re excited to grow that partnership with Coinshares to support the launch of wrapped-DGLD (wDGLD), an ERC-20 token that is pegged 1:1 with Gold. It combines the appeal of a gold-backed asset like DGLD — available for trading on the Blockchain.com Exchange — with the accessibility and flexibility of an ERC-20 token which you can use right here in the Blockchain.com Wallet or anywhere on the Ethereum Network. \n\nWith more and more crossover between gold investors and crypto investors, we’re pleased to provide the opportunity to trade or hold truly-digital gold in new and exciting ways. wDGLD is available to trade on the Blockchain.com Exchange and available for sending, receiving, storing, buying, selling and swapping in the Blockchain.com Wallet on web and mobile. Make sure to update to the latest version of the app to take full advantage of this feature.\n\nFor reference, what is DGLD? How does it work?\n\nDGLD is a digital asset representing allocated physical gold stored in a Swiss vault, and tokenized with a side-chain built on the Bitcoin network. In doing so, we’re empowering convenient, 24/7 purchasing of gold, with the independence of physical gold ownership.\n\nEach DGLD token is the digital equivalent of 1/10th of a troy ounce of gold, vaulted in Switzerland. Before a new token is created, gold is allocated and placed in the vault. Then, a DGLD representing that specific gold is created and sent to a DGLD wallet. This simple approach unleashes physical gold and renders it both digitally usable and physically redeemable.\n\nHow is DGLD Wrapped? \n\nWrapped-DGLD (wDGLD) is an ERC-20 token that lives on the Ethereum network that represents a unit of DGLD. It lives as a smart contract on the Ethereum network where all its transactions are auditable and public. You can now send and receive wDGLD in your Blockchain.com Wallet, as well as buy, sell or swap wDGLD against any other supported asset. Being an ERC-20 token, a small amount of ETH is require to send wDGLD. You can learn more about this here.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy do I need ETH to send wDGLD?\nAvatar\nJune 02, 2021 21:08\nWrapped-DGLD (wDGLD) is an ERC20 token. This means its transactions occur on the Ethereum blockchain, which requires that the sender pay a fee in ETH to ensure their transaction confirms. Learn more about ETH fees here.\n\nYou will need  ETH in order to send your wDGLD externally to a third-party exchange or platform. The amount of ETH needed will vary depending on current Ethereum network conditions, and Blockchain.com has no control over this, However, you do not need to keep an ETH balance in order to receive or to store wDLGD in your Wallet, nor do you need ETH to Swap wDGLD within your Trading Account. If you don’t have enough ETH to use your wDGLD, you can Swap for it from another cryptocurrency, receive it from another exchange or platform, or Buy it directly within your Blockchain.com Wallet.\n\n\n\nWhat is Bitcoin?\nAvatar\nMay 31, 2021 07:41\nBitcoin can often refer to two things. First, the Bitcoin network that keeps track of our transactions and balances, and second, the currency that we use as the unit of value when we transact. We'll cover both here. \n\nThe Bitcoin Network\n\nBitcoin's payment network (also called the bitcoin blockchain) is what makes it possible for us to transact with one another. The network uses distributed consensus to verify and confirm transactions, and consensus is reached via a large global network of high-performance computers (called miners) running the bitcoin software.\n\nWhenever someone sends a transaction it is broadcast instantly to the network and verified by the miners. Miners are constantly working to confirm individual transactions and include them in the next block of transactions in the chain. Once a new block is verified, all the transactions within it are permanently recorded on the blockchain. Rewards are paid out in bitcoin to miners who confirm transactions and verify the next block as a way to incentivize productivity on the network. \n\nEach party who participates in the mining process has an identical up-to-date copy of the blockchain or public ledger, which is a record of all the transactions in bitcoin history. Each party's copy of the ledger is updated every time a new block is found.\n\nThe Currency\n\nThe unit of value that we send and receive on the Bitcoin network is also referred to as bitcoin, or bitcoins. Bitcoin is completely digital, meaning we can't physically hold it in our hand. It's also portable, divisible, fungible, and irreversible.\n\nFor further explanation on the difference between the Bitcoin network and the currency, check out this blog post.\n\n\n\nWho created Bitcoin?\nAvatar\nJuly 02, 2021 18:42\nBitcoin’s existence began with an academic paper written in 2008 by a developer under the name of Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nThe paper described the foundation for what was intended to be a peer-to-peer electronic cash system that was secure, affordable, and efficient far beyond conventional banking standards. The system Satoshi described was developed into open-source software and the first bitcoin transaction (also known as the Genesis Block) was confirmed on January 3, 2009. \n\n\n\n\nExplaining bitcoin transaction fees\nAvatar\nMonday at 20:53\nEvery bitcoin transaction must be added to the blockchain, the official public ledger of all bitcoin transactions, in order to be considered successfully completed or valid. The work of validating transactions and adding them to the blockchain is done by miners, powerful computers that make up and connect to the network. Miners spend vast amounts of computing power and energy doing this for a financial reward: with every block (a collection of transactions not exceeding 1 MB in size) added to the blockchain comes a bounty called a block reward (currently 6.25 BTC), as well as all fees sent with the transactions that were included in the block.\n\nFor this reason, miners have a financial incentive to prioritize the validation of transactions that include a higher fee. For someone looking to send funds and get a quick confirmation, the appropriate fee to include can vary greatly, depending on a number of factors. While the fee does not depend on the amount you’re sending, it does depend on network conditions at the time and the data size of your transaction.\n\nNetwork conditions\n\nBecause a block on the bitcoin blockchain can only contain up to 1 MB of information, there is a limited number of transactions that can be included in any given block. During times of congestion, when a large number of users are sending funds, there can be more transactions awaiting confirmation than there is space in a block.\n\nWhen a user decides to send funds and the transaction is broadcast, it initially goes into what is called the memory pool (mempool for short) before being included into a block. It is from this mempool that miners choose which transactions to include, prioritizing the ones with higher fees. If the mempool is full, the fee market may turn into a competition: users will compete to get their transactions into the next block by including higher and higher fees. Eventually, the market will reach a maximum equilibrium fee that users are willing to pay and the miners will work through the entire mempool in order. At this point, once traffic has decreased, the equilibrium fee will go back down.\n\nTransaction size\n\nAgain due to the fact that a block on the bitcoin blockchain can contain no more than 1 MB of information, transaction size is an important consideration for miners. Smaller transactions are easier to validate; larger transactions take more work, and take up more space in the block. For this reason, miners prefer to include smaller transactions. A larger transaction will require a larger fee to be included in the next block.\n\nThere is no simple way to calculate a transaction size by hand. Your Blockchain.com Wallet will automatically do this for you, and suggest an appropriate fee.\n\nFees in the Blockchain.com Wallet\n\nBlockchain.com Wallet users will always have options when it comes to bitcoin transaction fees. Our wallet uses dynamic fees, meaning that the wallet will calculate the appropriate fee for your transaction taking into account current network conditions and transaction size.\n\nYou can choose between a Priority fee and a Regular fee. The Priority fee is calculated to get your transaction included in a block within the hour. The Regular fee is lower, and is for users who can afford to be a bit more patient; a confirmation for a transaction that includes a Regular fee will typically take a bit more than an hour.\n\nAdvanced users can set custom fees for their transaction in units of satoshi per byte (sat/b) by pressing Customize Fee and entering an amount. Please note that setting too low a fee may cause your transaction to remain unconfirmed for a long time and possibly be rejected. Customize your transaction fee at your own risk.\n\nMore information\n\nIf you want to take a deeper dive into bitcoin transaction fees, this blog post provides a comprehensive overview of what fees are and how they work, and this one elaborates on some frequently asked questions. If you have an unconfirmed transaction, you can learn more about what this means here.\n\n\n\n\nBitcoin Glossary\nAvatar\nAugust 02, 2021 01:08\nBlock\n\nBlocks are found in the Bitcoin blockchain. Blocks connect all transactions together. Transactions are combined into single blocks and are verified every ten minutes through mining. Each subsequent block strengthens the verification of the previous blocks, making it impossible to double spend bitcoin transactions (see double spend below).\n\nBIP\n\nBitcoin Improvement Proposal or BIP, is a technical design document providing information to the bitcoin community, or describing a new feature for bitcoin or its processes or environment which affect the Bitcoin protocol. New features, suggestions, and design changes to the protocol should be submitted as a BIP. The BIP author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.\n\nBlockchain\n\nThe Bitcoin blockchain is a public record of all Bitcoin transactions. You might also hear the term used as a “public ledger.” The blockchain shows every single record of bitcoin transactions in order, dating back to the very first one. The entire blockchain can be downloaded and openly reviewed by anyone, or you can use a block explorer to review the blockchain online.\n\nBlock Height\n\nThe block height is just the number of blocks connected together in the block chain. Height 0 for example refers to the very first block, called the “genesis block.”\n\nBlock Reward\n\nWhen a block is successfully mined on the bitcoin network, there is a block reward that helps incentivize miners to secure the network. The block reward is part of a “coinbase” transaction which may also include transaction fees. The block rewards halves roughly every four years; see also “halving.”\n\nChange\n\nLet’s say you are spending $1.90 in your local supermarket, and you give the cashier $2.00. You will get back .10 cents in change. The same logic applies to bitcoin transactions. Bitcoin transactions are made up of inputs and outputs. When you send bitcoins, you can only send them in a whole “output.” The change is then sent back to the sender.\n\nCold Storage\n\nThe term cold storage is a general term for different ways of securing your bitcoins offline (disconnected from the internet). This would be the opposite of a hot wallet or hosted wallet, which is connected to the web for day-to-day transactions. The purpose of using cold storage is to minimize the chances of your bitcoins being stolen from a malicious hacker and is commonly used for larger sums of bitcoins.\n\nConfirmation\n\nA confirmation means that the bitcoin transaction has been verified by the network, through the process known as mining. Once a transaction is confirmed, it cannot be reversed or double spent. Transactions are included in blocks.\n\nCryptography\n\nCryptography is used in multiple places to provide security for the Bitcoin network. Cryptography, which is essentially mathematical and computer science algorithms used to encrypt and decrypt information, is used in bitcoin addresses, hash functions, and the blockchain.\n\nDecentralized\n\nHaving a decentralized bitcoin network is a critical aspect. The network is “decentralized,” meaning that it’s void of a centralized company or entity that governs the network. Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer protocol, where all users within the network work and communicate directly with each other, instead of having their funds handled by a middleman, such as a bank or credit card company.\n\nDifficulty\n\nDifficulty is directly related to Bitcoin mining (see mining below), and how hard it is to verify blocks in the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin adjusts the mining difficulty of verifying blocks every 2016 blocks. Difficulty is automatically adjusted to keep block verification times at ten minutes.\n\nDouble Spend\n\nIf someone tries to send a bitcoin transaction to two different recipients at the same time, this is double spending. Once a bitcoin transaction is confirmed, it makes it nearly impossible to double spend it. The more confirmations that a transaction has, the harder it is to double spend the bitcoins.\n\nFull Node\n\nA full node is when you download the entire blockchain using a bitcoin client, and you relay, validate, and secure the data within the blockchain. The data is bitcoin transactions and blocks, which is validated across the entire network of users.\n\nHalving\n\nBitcoins have a finite supply, which makes them scarce. The total amount that will ever be issued is 21 million. The number of bitcoins generated per block is decreased 50% every four years. This is called “halving.” The final halving will take place in the year 2140.\n\nHash Rate\n\nThe hash rate is how the Bitcoin mining network processing power is measured. In order for miners to confirm transactions and secure the blockchain, the hardware they use must perform intensive computational operations which is output in hashes per second.\n\nHash (txid)\n\nA transaction hash (sometimes referred to as a transaction ID or txid) is a unique identifier that can be used on any block explorer to look up all of the public details of a particular transaction. Every on-chain transaction has a unique hash made up of a long string of alphanumeric characters.\n\nMining\n\nBitcoin mining is the process of using computer hardware to do mathematical calculations for the Bitcoin network in order to confirm transactions. Miners collect transaction fees for the transactions they confirm and are awarded bitcoins for each block they verify.\n\nPool\n\nAs part of bitcoin mining, mining “pools” are a network of miners that work together to mine a block, then split the block reward among the pool miners. Mining pools are a good way for miners to combine their resources to increase the probability of mining a block, and also contribute to the overall health and decentralization of the bitcoin network.\n\nPrivate Key\n\nA private key is a string of data that shows you have access to bitcoins in a specific wallet. Think of a private key like a password; private keys must never be revealed to anyone but you, as they allow you to spend the bitcoins from your bitcoin wallet through a cryptographic signature.\n\nProof of Work\n\nProof of work refers to the hash of a block header (blocks of bitcoin transactions). A block is considered valid only if its hash is lower than the current target. Each block refers to a previous block adding to previous proofs of work, which forms a chain of blocks, known as a blockchain. Once a chain is formed, it confirms all previous Bitcoin transactions and secures the network.\n\nPublic Address\n\nA public bitcoin address is cryptographic hash of a public key. A public address typically starts with the number “1.” Think of a public address like an email address. It can be published anywhere and bitcoins can be sent to it, just like an email can be sent to an email address. Learn how to receive bitcoin in your bitcoin wallet here.\n\nRBF\n\nRBF stands for Replace By Fee, and refers to a method that allows a sender to replace a “stuck” or unconfirmed transaction with a new one that uses a higher fee. This is done to make sure a transaction confirms as quickly as possible. The “replacement” transaction uses the same inputs as the original one. This is not considered a double spend, as the receiving address(es) typically remain the same.\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto\n\nBitcoin’s existence began with an academic paper written in 2008 by a developer under the name of Satoshi Nakamoto. Satoshi is the name used as the original inventor of Bitcoin. You can learn more about Satoshi here.\n\nTransaction\n\nA transaction is when data is sent to and from one bitcoin address to another. Just like financial transactions where you send money from one person to another, in bitcoin you do the same thing by sending data (bitcoins) to each other. Bitcoins have value because it’s based on the properties of mathematics, rather than relying on physical properties (like gold and silver) or trust in central authorities, like fiat currencies. \n\nWallet\n\nJust like with paper dollars you hold in your physical wallet, a bitcoin wallet is a digital wallet where you can store, send, and receive bitcoins securely. There are many varieties of wallets available, whether you’re looking for a web or mobile solution. Ideally, a bitcoin wallet will give you access to your public and private keys. This means that only you have rightful access to spend these bitcoins, whenever you choose to.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow can I look up a transaction on the blockchain? \nAvatar\nTuesday at 11:12\nBlock Explorers provide a visually appealing and intuitive way to navigate a cryptocurrency's blockchain. Our Block Explorer launched in August 2011. It began as a way for anyone to study bitcoin transactions, along with a variety of helpful charts and statistics about activity on the network. \n\nTo look up a bitcoin transaction, users can visit https://www.blockchain.com/explorer and use the search bar on the upper right to learn more about a particular bitcoin address, transaction hash, or block number by entering it in the search field.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnatomy of a Bitcoin Transaction\nAvatar\nToday at 10:13\nTransactions are the most important aspect of the Bitcoin network. Everything else is built and designed to ensure transactions can be effectively broadcast, validated, and confirmed. Transactions are made up of inputs and outputs; inputs are what go into a transaction (roughly speaking, inputs make up what is being sent), and outputs are what come out (making up what is being received). The outputs of one transaction can then be spent as the inputs of another one. To read a more in-depth explanation of inputs and outputs, visit our article on change addresses.\n\nNodes track spendable transaction outputs, or outputs that have not yet been used in another, subsequent transaction. These are known as unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs). When you view your transaction on the Blockchain.com Explorer, you will see the transaction inputs on the left and the outputs on the right. Each output will have either a red or a green icon next to it. Red means the output has already been spent in a subsequent transaction, and cannot be spent again. Green means the output is a UTXO, and is available for spending. Hover over the icon to see if an output is spent or unspent.\n\nThe only exception to the output and input chain is the coinbase transaction, which is the first transaction in every block. This transaction creates brand-new bitcoin by paying out the block reward to the miner that added the block to the blockchain. The input of this transaction is not a UTXO from a previous transaction, but rather a special type of input called the coinbase. This is also the process by which the bitcoin money supply increases until it hits the cap of 21 million bitcoin.\n\nAlthough most transactions are structured as payments to addresses (based on a script called Pay-to-Public-Key-Hash, or P2PKH), bitcoin transactions can use other types of scripts as well, and include additional data besides addresses and amounts. On the Blockchain.com Explorer, these will be listed at the bottom of the transaction page under the Outputs header.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

For the data center technology company, see Fungible Inc.\n\nThis article needs additional citations for verification. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed.\nFind sources: \"Fungibility\" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR (June 2012) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)\nIn economics, fungibility is the property of a good or a commodity whose individual units are essentially interchangeable and each of whose parts is indistinguishable from another part.[1][2]\n\nFor example, gold is fungible since a specified amount of pure gold is equivalent to that same amount of pure gold, whether in the form of coins, ingots, or in other states. Other fungible commodities include sweet crude oil, company shares, bonds, other precious metals, and currencies.\n\nFungibility refers only to the equivalence and indistinguishability of each unit of a commodity with other units of the same commodity, and not to the exchange of one commodity for another.\n\n\nContents\n1\tEtymology\n2\tUsage\n2.1\tFinance\n2.1.1\tCryptocurrency\n2.2\tTasking\n2.3\tQuantum physics\n2.4\tLaw\n2.4.1\tUnited States\n2.4.2\tBelgium\n3\tSee also\n4\tReferences\n5\tFurther reading\nEtymology\nThe word fungibility comes from the Latin fungibilis, from the verb fungī, meaning \"to perform\". It is related to words such as \"function\" and \"defunct\".[3] It is unrelated to the Latin and English noun fungus or its plural, \"fungi\". \n\nUsage\n\tLook up fungible in Wiktionary, the free dictionary.\nFinance\nFungibility is different from liquidity. A good is said to be liquid if it can be easily exchanged for money or another good. A good is fungible if one unit of the good is substantially equivalent to another unit of the same good of the same quality at the same time, place, etc.\n\nNotably, money is fungible: one US $10 banknote is interchangeable with any other genuine banknote like it.[4] It is also interchangeable with two fives, ten ones, or any other combination of banknotes and coins adding up to $10.\n\nOn the other hand, diamonds and other gems are not perfectly fungible because their varying cuts, colors, grades, and sizes make it difficult to find several diamonds expected to have the same value. Packaged products on a retail shelf may be considered fungible if they are of the same type and equivalent in function and form. Customers and clerks can interchange packages freely until purchase, and sometimes afterward. After one opens the package and uses the product, however, it is usually considered unique and no longer interchangeable with unopened packages outside of exceptional circumstances, such as a return or exchange.\n\nCryptocurrency\nSee also: Non-fungible token\nCryptocurrencies are usually considered to be fungible assets, where one coin is equivalent to another. However, after a major breach in Japanese exchange Coincheck, token developers for cryptocurrency NEM added a special flag to hacked coins to indicate they are not to be traded or used.[5]\n\nTasking\nFungibility has been used to describe certain types of tasks that can be broken down into interchangeable pieces that are easily parallelized and are not interdependent on the other pieces. For example: If a worker can hand dig one meter of ditch in a day, and a ten-meter ditch needs to be dug, that worker can either be given ten days to complete the entire project, or nine more workers can be hired for a single day. Each worker can complete their piece of the project without interfering with the other workers, and more importantly, each worker is not dependent on the results of any of the other workers to complete their share of the total project.\n\nOn the other hand, non-fungible tasks tend to be highly serial in nature and require the completion of earlier steps before later steps can even be started. As an example of a serial task that is not fungible, suppose there was a group of nine newly pregnant women. After one month, these women would have experienced a total of nine months of pregnancy, but a complete baby would not have been formed.\n\nQuantum physics\nOxford University theoretical physicist David Deutsch has adopted the term \"fungible\" to describe the physical nature of quantum particles and universes within the quantum multiverse, where, by virtue of being identical in all respects, different particles chaotically divide or combine as a result of physical interactions from a common fungible fund in superposition.[6]\n\nLaw\nUnited States\n\nThis section may require cleanup to meet Wikipedia's quality standards. The specific problem is: section needed for use of Fungible in context of evidence. Please help improve this section if you can. (October 2019) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)\nIn legal disputes in the United States, when one party is compelled to remedy another party as the result of a ruling or adjudication, the appropriate legal remedy may depend on the fungibility of the underlying right, obligation or property interest that is intended to be restored.[7] Depending on whether the interests of the aggrieved party are fungible, a determination made by the trier of fact, the appropriate remedy may change. For example, a court may require specific performance (an equitable remedy) as a remedy for breach of contract, instead of the more favored remedy of monetary damages.[8]\n\nBelgium\nBelgium has adopted fungibility for its domestic central securities depository, CIK (Euroclear), which was set up in 1967–1968. According to royal decree No. 62, issued on 10 November 1967, depositors of fungible securities have the rights of co-ownership. This change was fundamental to the development of Euroclear, by then beginning to process Eurobonds and build systems.[9]",

          "context": "What is blockchain technology?\nAvatar\nAugust 08, 2021 17:16\nThe Bitcoin Network is the first successful implementation of blockchain technology.\n\nThe term \"blockchain technology\" typically refers to the transparent, trustless, publicly accessible ledger that allows us to securely transfer the ownership of units of value using public key encryption and proof of work methods.\n\nThe technology uses decentralized consensus to maintain the network, which means it is not centrally controlled by a bank, corporation, or government. In fact, the larger the network grows and becomes increasingly decentralized, the more secure it becomes. \n\nThe potential for blockchain technology is not limited to bitcoin. As such, it has gained a lot of attention in a variety of industries including: financial services, charities and nonprofits, the arts, and e-commerce.\n\nTo learn more about the inner-workings of the Bitcoin Network, check out this article. \n\n\nYour Wallet & Its Master Seed\nAvatar\nJuly 14, 2021 04:03\nOur wallet is built on an HD (or hierarchical deterministic) framework, which is the industry standard for bitcoin address generation and management. Each public address your wallet generates stems from your wallet's xPub (or Extended Public Key). Once your public address receives an incoming payment, a new address will automatically be generated and display when you click on receive.\n\nIf you use the same address each time you receive funds, it becomes easy for anyone to track your entire payment history. This method of address generation improves privacy by automatically presenting you with a new address when you’re expecting payment.\n\nAdvanced Users: Our wallet implements BIP44 to generate accounts and addresses, and the recovery mnemonic/seed (present in legacy wallets created in 2016 and prior) implements BIP39. The seed is compatible with other BIP44/BIP39 bitcoin wallets.\n\n\nTransaction fees\nAvatar\nYesterday at 03:20\nEvery cryptocurrency transaction must be added to the blockchain, the official public ledger of all completed transactions, in order to be considered a successful and valid transfer. The work of validating transactions and adding them to the blockchain is done by miners, which are powerful computers that make up a portion of the network and confirm its transactions. Miners spend vast amounts of computing power and energy doing this for a financial reward: with every block (a collection of transactions) added to the blockchain comes a bounty called a block reward, as well as all fees sent with the transactions that were confirmed and included in the block.\n\nFor this reason, miners have a financial incentive to prioritize the validation of transactions that include a higher fee. For someone looking to send funds and get a quick confirmation, the appropriate fee to include depends on the cryptocurrency being sent and can vary greatly, depending on a number of factors, such as transaction size and network conditions.\n\nYour Blockchain wallet will automatically calculate the appropriate fee for sending your chosen cryptocurrency. The fee for sending ether is static (you can view the fee for sending ether by clicking “Send” and selecting Ether as the currency), while the fees for sending bitcoin, bitcoin cash, and stellar are dynamic and will be calculated by your wallet after you input the amount you want to send. This article explains bitcoin transaction fees in greater detail.\n\n\nRejected Transactions\nAvatar\nMay 02, 2021 06:03\nIn most cases, the cryptocurrency transactions you send will confirm normally without any problems. There are some circumstances, however, that may lead a transaction to be unsuccessful and fail. When this happens, the transaction is considered rejected. In this article, we’ll explain what this means, why a transaction may reject, and what happens to those funds.\n\nThe role of fees\nTo explain rejected transactions, we’ll touch on the purpose of fees first. The fees you include with your transactions are collected by miners, which are responsible for confirming transactions on the network. A higher fee will help increase your transaction priority, so it is likely to confirm more quickly. In contrast, a lower fee means it may take longer. If the fee you include is too low, there is a possibility miners will not consider it worthwhile to validate. When this happens, miners will reject the transaction.\n\nReasons a transaction may be rejected\nToo low of a fee (or using no fee at all) is one of the most common reasons why a transaction gets rejected. When too low of a fee is used during periods of network congestion, this can increase the likelihood it will not successfully send. Because of how cryptocurrency networks are designed, we have no power to prevent a pending transaction from being rejected. It is entirely up to miners.\n\nMy transaction was rejected. Now what?\nUnlike confirmed transactions, rejected transactions do not appear on the blockchain. When a transaction is rejected, it’s as if it never occurred in the first place. In fact, the sender will see those funds instantly re-appear at the address they attempted to send from.\n\nBefore you attempt the transaction again, you’ll need to make sure your fee is sufficient. An easy way to do this in the Blockchain.com Wallet is to choose a regular fee. Our Wallet automatically calculates the most appropriate fee for you based on current network conditions and aspects of your transaction. For urgent transactions, a priority fee will help make sure your transaction confirms more quickly. Unless you’re an advanced user, avoid setting a custom fee. If the custom fee is too low, your transaction may reject a second time.\n\nFor any follow-up questions about rejected transactions, don’t hesitate to reach out @AskBlockchain or by submitting a support request.\n\n\n\nnderstanding the xPub and address generation\nAvatar\nJuly 29, 2021 17:44\nFor maximum privacy, our wallet generates new bitcoin and bitcoin cash addresses every time funds are received. Our wallet is built on an HD (or hierarchical deterministic) framework, a privacy-centered method for address generation and management. Each public address your wallet generates stems from your wallet's xPub (or Extended Public Key). Each time you receive funds, your wallet will use the xPub to generate a new receiving address.*\n\nWhen you create a new sub-wallet (or wallet category) in the Addresses section of your wallet Settings, you generate a new xPub for your wallet to use for address generation. By default, clicking Request will fetch a new address from the xPub of your default sub-wallet (for all new wallets, this is My Bitcoin Wallet, but this can be changed within Settings > Addresses). When you choose a different sub-wallet from the Receive To: dropdown menu, your wallet will generate a new address from the xPub of that sub-wallet.\n\nYou only need to back up your wallet once; all of your sub-wallets are backed up by a single 12-word recovery phrase. Since the recovery phrase is the seed from which every xPub’s corresponding xPriv (extended private key) is derived, all of the private keys of all addresses derived within the wallet are contained within it. Read more about public and private keys here.\n\nWe strongly advise against showing your xPub to third parties. Knowledge of the xPub can enable someone to track your wallet’s entire payment history and possibly disrupt access to your funds. If you are having an issue and reach out to us by submitting a ticket, on rare occasion, our support team may ask for your xPub in order to diagnose your issue. Please note that this is the only channel by which we would ask for this information. We strongly recommend never revealing your xPub on any public channel, including social media, or to anyone else.\n\n*While bitcoin and bitcoin cash addresses, once generated, never become invalid and can be used to receive multiple payments, we recommend using a new address for each transaction. If you use the same address each time you receive funds, it becomes easy for anyone to track your entire payment history.\n\n\nPublic and private keys\nAvatar\nAugust 04, 2021 05:26\nBitcoin, as well as all other major cryptocurrencies that came after it, is built upon public-key cryptography, a cryptographic system that uses pairs of keys: public keys, which are publicly known and essential for identification, and private keys, which are kept secret and are used for authentication and encryption.\n\nMajor cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Bitcoin Cash function using three fundamental pieces of information: the address, associated with a balance and used for sending and receiving funds, and the address’ corresponding public and private keys. The generation of a bitcoin address begins with the generation of a private key. From there, its corresponding public key can be derived using a known algorithm. The address, which can then be used in transactions, is a shorter, representative form of the public key.\n\nThe private key is what grants a cryptocurrency user ownership of the funds on a given address. The Blockchain wallet automatically generates and stores private keys for you. When you send from a Blockchain wallet, the software signs the transaction with your private key (without actually disclosing it), which indicates to the entire network that you have the authority to transfer the funds on the address you’re sending from.\n\nThe security of this system comes from the one-way street that is getting from the private key to the public address. It is not possible to derive the public key from the address; likewise, it is impossible to derive the private key from the public key. In the Blockchain.com Wallet, your 12-word Secret Private Key Recovery Phrase is a seed of all the private keys of all the addresses generated within the wallet. This is what allows you to restore access to your funds even if you lose access to your original wallet. Using the recovery phrase will allow you to recover your crypto.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "context": "Smart contract\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\nJump to navigationJump to search\nA smart contract is a computer program or a transaction protocol which is intended to automatically execute, control or document legally relevant events and actions according to the terms of a contract or an agreement.[1][2][3][4] The objectives of smart contracts are the reduction of need in trusted intermediators, arbitrations and enforcement costs, fraud losses, as well as the reduction of malicious and accidental exceptions.[5][2]\n\nVending machines are mentioned as the oldest piece of technology equivalent to smart contract implementation.[3] 2014's white paper about the cryptocurrency Ethereum[6] describes the Bitcoin protocol as a weak version of the smart contract concept as defined by computer scientist, lawyer and cryptographer Nick Szabo. Since Ethereum, various cryptocurrencies support scripting languages which allow for more advanced smart contracts between untrusted parties.[7] Smart contracts should be distinguished from smart legal contracts. The latter refers to a traditional natural language legally-binding agreement which has certain terms expressed and implemented in machine-readable code.[8][9][10]\n\n\nContents\n1\tEtymology\n2\tLegal status of smart contracts\n3\tWorkings\n4\tApplications\n5\tSecurity issues\n6\tDifference from smart legal contracts\n7\tSee also\n8\tReferences\nEtymology\nSmart contracts were first proposed in the early 1990s by Nick Szabo, who coined the term, using it to refer to \"a set of promises, specified in digital form, including protocols within which the parties perform on these promises\".[11][12] In 1998, the term was used to describe objects in rights management service layer of the system The Stanford Infobus, which was a part of Stanford Digital Library Project.[1]\n\nLegal status of smart contracts\nSee also: Regulation of algorithms\nA smart contract does not necessarily constitute a valid binding agreement at law. Some legal academics claim that smart contracts are not legal agreements, but rather means of performing obligations deriving from other agreements[13] such as technological means for the automation of payment obligations[14] or obligations consisting in the transfer of tokens or cryptocurrencies. Additionally, other scholars have argued that the imperative or declarative nature of programming languages can impact the legal validity of smart contracts.[15]\n\nSince the 2015 launch of the Ethereum blockchain,[16] the term \"smart contract\" has been more specifically applied toward the notion of general purpose computation that takes place on a blockchain or distributed ledger. The US National Institute of Standards and Technology describes a \"smart contract\" as a \"collection of code and data (sometimes referred to as functions and state) that is deployed using cryptographically signed transactions on the blockchain network\".[17] In this interpretation, used for example by the Ethereum Foundation[6] or IBM,[18] a smart contract is not necessarily related to the classical concept of a contract, but can be any kind of computer program. A smart contract also can be regarded as a secured stored procedure as its execution and codified effects like the transfer of some value between parties are strictly enforced and can not be manipulated, after a transaction with specific contract details is stored into a blockchain or distributed ledger. That's because the actual execution of contracts is controlled and audited by the platform, not by any arbitrary server-side programs connecting to the platform.[19][20]\n\nIn 2017, by implementing the Decree on Development of Digital Economy, Belarus has become the first-ever country to legalize smart contracts. Belarusian lawyer Denis Aleinikov is considered to be the author of a smart contract legal concept introduced by the decree.[21]\n\nIn 2018, a US Senate report said: \"While smart contracts might sound new, the concept is rooted in basic contract law. Usually, the judicial system adjudicates contractual disputes and enforces terms, but it is also common to have another arbitration method, especially for international transactions. With smart contracts, a program enforces the contract built into the code.\"[22] A number of states in the US have passed legislation on the use of smart contracts, such as Arizona,[23] Nevada,[24] Tennessee,[25] and Wyoming.[citation needed][26] And in April 2020, Iowa's House of Representatives passed a bill legally recognizing smart contacts in the state.[27]\n\nIn April 2021, the UK Jurisdiction Taskforce (UKJT) published the Digital Dispute Resolution Rules (the Digital DR Rules) to help enable the rapid resolution of blockchain and crypto legal disputes in Britain.[28]\n\nWorkings\nSimilar to a transfer of value on a blockchain, deployment of a smart contract on a blockchain occurs by sending a transaction from a wallet for the blockchain.[29] The transaction includes the compiled code for the smart contract as well as a special receiver address.[29] That transaction must then be included in a block that is added to the blockchain, at which point the smart contract's code will execute to establish the initial state of the smart contract.[29] Byzantine fault-tolerant algorithms secure the smart contract in a decentralized way from attempts to tamper with it. Once a smart contract is deployed, it cannot be updated.[30] Smart contracts on a blockchain can store arbitrary state and execute arbitrary computations. End clients interact with a smart contract through transactions. Such transactions with a smart contract can invoke other smart contracts. These transactions might result in changing the state and sending coins from one smart contract to another or from one account to another.[30]\n\nThe most popular blockchain for running smart contracts is Ethereum.[31] On Ethereum, smart contracts are typically written in a Turing-complete programming language called Solidity,[32] and compiled into low-level bytecode to be executed by the Ethereum Virtual Machine.[33] Due to the halting problem and other security problems, Turing-completeness is considered to be a risk and is deliberately avoided by languages like Vyper.[34][35] Some of the other smart contract programming languages missing Turing-completeness are Simplicity, Scilla, Ivy and Bitcoin Script.[35] However, measurements using regular expressions showed that only 35.3% of 53,757 Ethereum smart contracts included recursions and loops — constructs connected to the halting problem.[36]\n\nSeveral languages are designed to enable formal verification: Bamboo, IELE, Simplicity, Michelson (can be verified with Coq),[35] Liquidity (compiles to Michelson), Scilla, DAML and Pact.[34]\n\nNotable examples of blockchain platforms supporting smart contracts include the following:\nName\tDescription\nBitcoin\tProvides a Turing-incomplete script language that allows the creation of custom smart contracts on top of Bitcoin like multisignature accounts, payment channels, escrows, time locks, atomic cross-chain trading, oracles, or multi-party lottery with no operator.[37]\nCardano\tA blockchain platform for smart contracts, using proof of stake\nEthereum\tImplements a Turing-complete language on its blockchain, a prominent smart contract framework[38]\nEOS.IO\tA blockchain platform for smart contracts\nTezos\tA blockchain platform modifying its own set of rules with minimal disruption to the network through an on-chain governance model\nProcesses on a blockchain are generally deterministic in order to ensure Byzantine fault-tolerance.[39] Nevertheless, real world application of smart contracts, such as lotteries and casinos, require secure randomness.[40] In fact, blockchain technology reduces the costs for conducting of a lottery and is therefore beneficial for the participants. Randomness on blockchain can be implemented by using block hashes or timestamps, oracles, commitment schemes, special smart contracts like RANDAO[41][42] and Quanta as well as sequences from mixed strategy Nash equilibria.[39]\n\nApplications\nIn 1998, Szabo proposed that smart contract infrastructure can be implemented by replicated asset registries and contract execution using cryptographic hash chains and Byzantine fault-tolerant replication.[43] Askemos implemented this approach in 2002[44][45] using Scheme (later adding SQLite[46][47]) as contract script language.[48]\n\nOne proposal for using bitcoin for replicated asset registration and contract execution is called \"colored coins\".[49] Replicated titles for potentially arbitrary forms of property, along with replicated contract execution, are implemented in different projects.\n\nAs of 2015, UBS was experimenting with \"smart bonds\" that use the bitcoin blockchain[50] in which payment streams could hypothetically be fully automated, creating a self-paying instrument.[51]\n\nInheritance wishes could hypothetically be implemented automatically upon registration of a death certificate by means of smart contracts.[52][53] Birth certificates can also work together with smart contracts.[54][55]\n\nSmart contracts can also be used to handle real estate transactions [56] (i.e. via Propy, ...)[57] [58] and blockchain solutions are also proliferating on the field of title records and in the public register.[59][60][61][62][63]\n\nSmart contracts can also be used in employment contracts, especially temporary employment contracts, offering benefits for both employer and employee.[64][65]\n\nSecurity issues\nA blockchain-based smart contract is visible to all users of said blockchain. However, this leads to a situation where bugs, including security holes, are visible to all yet may not be quickly fixed.[66] Such an attack, difficult to fix quickly, was successfully executed on The DAO in June 2016, draining approximately US$50 million worth of Ether at the time, while developers attempted to come to a solution that would gain consensus.[67] The DAO program had a time delay in place before the hacker could remove the funds; a hard fork of the Ethereum software was done to claw back the funds from the attacker before the time limit expired.[68] Other high-profile attacks include the Parity multisignature wallet attacks, and an integer underflow/overflow attack (2018), totaling over US$184 million.[69]\n\nIssues in Ethereum smart contracts, in particular, include ambiguities and easy-but-insecure constructs in its contract language Solidity, compiler bugs, Ethereum Virtual Machine bugs, attacks on the blockchain network, the immutability of bugs and that there is no central source documenting known vulnerabilities, attacks and problematic constructs.[38]\n\nDifference from smart legal contracts\nSmart legal contracts are distinct from smart contracts. As mentioned above, a smart contract is not necessarily legally enforceable as a contract. On the other hand, a smart legal contract has all the elements of a legally enforceable contract in the jurisdiction in which it can be enforced and it can be enforced by a court or tribunal. Therefore, while every smart legal contract will contain some elements of a smart contract, not every smart contract will be a smart legal contract.[70]\n\nThere is no formal definition of a smart legal contract in the legal industry.[71]\n\nA Ricardian contract is a type of smart legal contract.",

The security of the system depends on the secrecy of the private key, which must not become known to any other.\n\nIn the Diffie–Hellman key exchange scheme, each party generates a public/private key pair and distributes the public key of the pair. After obtaining an authentic (n.b., this is critical) copy of each other's public keys, Alice and Bob can compute a shared secret offline. The shared secret can be used, for instance, as the key for a symmetric cipher which will be, in essentially all cases, much faster.\n\nIn this example the message is digitally signed, but not encrypted. 1) Alice signs a message with her private key. 2) Bob can verify that Alice sent the message and that the message has not been modified.\nPublic-key cryptography, or asymmetric cryptography, is a cryptographic system that uses pairs of keys: public keys (which may be known to others), and private keys (which may never be known by any except the owner). The generation of such key pairs depends on cryptographic algorithms which are based on mathematical problems termed one-way functions. Effective security requires keeping the private key private; the public key can be openly distributed without compromising security.[1]\n\nIn such a system, any person can encrypt a message using the intended receiver's public key, but that encrypted message can only be decrypted with the receiver's private key. This allows, for instance, a server program to generate a cryptographic key intended for a suitable symmetric-key cryptography, then to use a client's openly-shared public key to encrypt that newly generated symmetric key. The server can then send this encrypted symmetric key over an insecure channel to the client; only the client can decrypt it using the client's private key (which pairs with the public key used by the server to encrypt the message). With the client and server both having the same symmetric key, they can safely use symmetric key encryption (likely much faster) to communicate over otherwise-insecure channels. This scheme has the advantage of not having to manually pre-share symmetric keys (a fundamentally difficult problem) while gaining the higher data throughput advantage of symmetric-key cryptography.\n\nWith public-key cryptography, robust authentication is also possible. A sender can combine a message with a private key to create a short digital signature on the message. Anyone with the sender's corresponding public key can combine that message with a claimed digital signature; if the signature matches the message, the origin of the message is verified (i.e., it must have been made by the owner of the corresponding private key).[2][3]\n\nPublic key algorithms are fundamental security primitives in modern cryptosystems, including applications and protocols which offer assurance of the confidentiality, authenticity and non-repudiability of electronic communications and data storage. They underpin numerous Internet standards, such as Transport Layer Security (TLS), S/MIME, PGP, and GPG. Some public key algorithms provide key distribution and secrecy (e.g., Diffie–Hellman key exchange), some provide digital signatures (e.g., Digital Signature Algorithm), and some provide both (e.g., RSA). Compared to symmetric encryption, asymmetric encryption is rather slower than good symmetric encryption, too slow for many purposes. Today's cryptosystems (such as TLS, Secure Shell) use both symmetric encryption and asymmetric encryption, often by using asymmetric encryption to securely exchange a secret key which is then used for symmetric encryption.\n\n\nContents\n1\tDescription\n2\tApplications\n2.1\tHybrid Cryptosystems\n3\tWeaknesses\n3.1\tAlgorithms\n3.2\tAlteration of public keys\n3.3\tPublic key infrastructure\n4\tExamples\n5\tHistory\n5.1\tAnticipation\n5.2\tClassified discovery\n5.3\tPublic discovery\n6\tSee also\n7\tNotes\n8\tReferences\n9\tExternal links\nDescription\nBefore the mid-1970s, all cipher systems used symmetric key algorithms, in which the same cryptographic key is used with the underlying algorithm by both the sender and the recipient, who must both keep it secret. Of necessity, the key in every such system had to be exchanged between the communicating parties in some secure way prior to any use of the system – for instance, via a secure channel. This requirement is never trivial and very rapidly becomes unmanageable as the number of participants increases, or when secure channels aren't available, or when, (as is sensible cryptographic practice), keys are frequently changed. In particular, if messages are meant to be secure from other users, a separate key is required for each possible pair of users.\n\nBy contrast, in a public key system, the public keys can be disseminated widely and openly, and only the corresponding private keys need be kept secret by its owner.\n\nTwo of the best-known uses of public key cryptography are:\n\nPublic key encryption, in which a message is encrypted with the intended recipient's public key. For properly chosen and used algorithms, messages cannot in practice be decrypted by anyone who does not possess the matching private key, who is thus presumed to be the owner of that key and so the person associated with the public key. This can be used to ensure confidentiality of a message.\nDigital signatures, in which a message is signed with the sender's private key and can be verified by anyone who has access to the sender's public key. This verification proves that the sender had access to the private key, and therefore is very likely to be the person associated with the public key. This also ensures that the message has not been tampered with, as a signature is mathematically bound to the message it originally was made from, and verification will fail for practically any other message, no matter how similar to the original message.\nOne important issue is confidence/proof that a particular public key is authentic, i.e. that it is correct and belongs to the person or entity claimed, and has not been tampered with or replaced by some (perhaps malicious) third party. There are several possible approaches, including:\n\nA public key infrastructure (PKI), in which one or more third parties – known as certificate authorities – certify ownership of key pairs. TLS relies upon this. This implies that the PKI system (software, hardware, and management) is trust-able by all involved.\n\nA \"web of trust\" which decentralizes authentication by using individual endorsements of links between a user and the public key belonging to that user. PGP uses this approach, in addition to lookup in the domain name system (DNS). The DKIM system for digitally signing emails also uses this approach.\n\nApplications\nThe most obvious application of a public key encryption system is for encrypting communication to provide confidentiality – a message that a sender encrypts using the recipient's public key which can be decrypted only by the recipient's paired private key.\n\nAnother application in public key cryptography is the digital signature. Digital signature schemes can be used for sender authentication.\n\nNon-repudiation systems use digital signatures to ensure that one party cannot successfully dispute its authorship of a document or communication.\n\nFurther applications built on this foundation include: digital cash, password-authenticated key agreement, time-stamping services, non-repudiation protocols, etc.\n\nHybrid Cryptosystems\nBecause asymmetric key algorithms are nearly always much more computationally intensive than symmetric ones, it is common to use a public/private asymmetric key-exchange algorithm to encrypt and exchange a symmetric key, which is then used by symmetric-key cryptography to transmit data using the now-shared symmetric key for a symmetric key encryption algorithm. PGP, SSH, and the SSL/TLS family of schemes use this procedure; they are thus called hybrid cryptosystems. The initial asymmetric cryptography-based key exchange to share a server-generated symmetric key from the server to client has the advantage of not requiring that a symmetric key be pre-shared manually, such as on printed paper or discs transported by a courier, while providing the higher data throughput of symmetric key cryptography over asymmetric key cryptography for the remainder of the shared connection.\n\nWeaknesses\nAs with all security-related systems, it is important to identify potential weaknesses. Aside from poor choice of an asymmetric key algorithm (there are few which are widely regarded as satisfactory) or too short a key length, the chief security risk is that the private key of a pair becomes known. All security of messages, authentication, etc., will then be lost.\n\nAlgorithms\nAll public key schemes are in theory susceptible to a \"brute-force key search attack\".[4] However, such an attack is impractical if the amount of computation needed to succeed – termed the \"work factor\" by Claude Shannon – is out of reach of all potential attackers. In many cases, the work factor can be increased by simply choosing a longer key. But other algorithms may inherently have much lower work factors, making resistance to a brute-force attack (e.g., from longer keys) irrelevant. Some special and specific algorithms have been developed to aid in attacking some public key encryption algorithms – both RSA and ElGamal encryption have known attacks that are much faster than the brute-force approach.[5] None of these are sufficiently improved to be actually practical, however.\n\nMajor weaknesses have been found for several formerly promising asymmetric key algorithms. The \"knapsack packing\" algorithm was found to be insecure after the development of a new attack.[6] As with all cryptographic functions, public-key implementations may be vulnerable to side-channel attacks that exploit information leakage to simplify the search for a secret key. These are often independent of the algorithm being used. Research is underway to both discover, and to protect against, new attacks.\n\nAlteration of public keys\nAnother potential security vulnerability in using asymmetric keys is the possibility of a \"man-in-the-middle\" attack, in which the communication of public keys is intercepted by a third party (the \"man in the middle\") and then modified to provide different public keys instead. Encrypted messages and responses must, in all instances, be intercepted, decrypted, and re-encrypted by the attacker using the correct public keys for the different communication segments so as to avoid suspicion.\n\nA communication is said to be insecure where data is transmitted in a manner that allows for interception (also called \"sniffing\"). These terms refer to reading the sender's private data in its entirety. A communication is particularly unsafe when interceptions can't be prevented or monitored by the sender.[7]\n\nA man-in-the-middle attack can be difficult to implement due to the complexities of modern security protocols. However, the task becomes simpler when a sender is using insecure media such as public networks, the Internet, or wireless communication. In these cases an attacker can compromise the communications infrastructure rather than the data itself. A hypothetical malicious staff member at an Internet Service Provider (ISP) might find a man-in-the-middle attack relatively straightforward. Capturing the public key would only require searching for the key as it gets sent through the ISP's communications hardware; in properly implemented asymmetric key schemes, this is not a significant risk.\n\nIn some advanced man-in-the-middle attacks, one side of the communication will see the original data while the other will receive a malicious variant. Asymmetric man-in-the-middle attacks can prevent users from realizing their connection is compromised. This remains so even when one user's data is known to be compromised because the data appears fine to the other user. This can lead to confusing disagreements between users such as \"it must be on your end!\" when neither user is at fault. Hence, man-in-the-middle attacks are only fully preventable when the communications infrastructure is physically controlled by one or both parties; such as via a wired route inside the sender's own building. In summation, public keys are easier to alter when the communications hardware used by a sender is controlled by an attacker.[8][9][10]\n\nPublic key infrastructure\nOne approach to prevent such attacks involves the use of a public key infrastructure (PKI); a set of roles, policies, and procedures needed to create, manage, distribute, use, store and revoke digital certificates and manage public-key encryption. However, this has potential weaknesses.\n\nFor example, the certificate authority issuing the certificate must be trusted by all participating parties to have properly checked the identity of the key-holder, to have ensured the correctness of the public key when it issues a certificate, to be secure from computer piracy, and to have made arrangements with all participants to check all their certificates before protected communications can begin. Web browsers, for instance, are supplied with a long list of \"self-signed identity certificates\" from PKI providers – these are used to check the bona fides of the certificate authority and then, in a second step, the certificates of potential communicators. An attacker who could subvert one of those certificate authorities into issuing a certificate for a bogus public key could then mount a \"man-in-the-middle\" attack as easily as if the certificate scheme were not used at all. In an alternative scenario rarely discussed,[citation needed] an attacker who penetrates an authority's servers and obtains its store of certificates and keys (public and private) would be able to spoof, masquerade, decrypt, and forge transactions without limit.\n\nDespite its theoretical and potential problems, this approach is widely used. Examples include TLS and its predecessor SSL, which are commonly used to provide security for web browser transactions (for example, to securely send credit card details to an online store).\n\nAside from the resistance to attack of a particular key pair, the security of the certification hierarchy must be considered when deploying public key systems. Some certificate authority – usually a purpose-built program running on a server computer – vouches for the identities assigned to specific private keys by producing a digital certificate. Public key digital certificates are typically valid for several years at a time, so the associated private keys must be held securely over that time. When a private key used for certificate creation higher in the PKI server hierarchy is compromised, or accidentally disclosed, then a \"man-in-the-middle attack\" is possible, making any subordinate certificate wholly insecure.",

Peers are equally privileged, equipotent participants in the application. They are said to form a peer-to-peer network of nodes.\n\nPeers make a portion of their resources, such as processing power, disk storage or network bandwidth, directly available to other network participants, without the need for central coordination by servers or stable hosts.[1] Peers are both suppliers and consumers of resources, in contrast to the traditional client–server model in which the consumption and supply of resources is divided.[2]\n\nWhile P2P systems had previously been used in many application domains,[3] the architecture was popularized by the file sharing system Napster, originally released in 1999.[4] The concept has inspired new structures and philosophies in many areas of human interaction. In such social contexts, peer-to-peer as a meme refers to the egalitarian social networking that has emerged throughout society, enabled by Internet technologies in general.\n\n\nContents\n1\tHistorical development\n2\tArchitecture\n2.1\tRouting and resource discovery\n2.1.1\tUnstructured networks\n2.1.2\tStructured networks\n2.1.3\tHybrid models\n2.1.4\tCoopNet content distribution system\n2.2\tSecurity and trust\n2.2.1\tRouting attacks\n2.2.2\tCorrupted data and malware\n2.3\tResilient and scalable computer networks\n2.4\tDistributed storage and search\n3\tApplications\n3.1\tContent delivery\n3.2\tFile-sharing networks\n3.2.1\tCopyright infringements\n3.3\tMultimedia\n3.4\tOther P2P applications\n4\tSocial implications\n4.1\tIncentivizing resource sharing and cooperation\n4.1.1\tPrivacy and anonymity\n5\tPolitical implications\n5.1\tIntellectual property law and illegal sharing\n5.2\tNetwork neutrality\n6\tCurrent research\n7\tSee also\n8\tReferences\n9\tExternal links\nHistorical development\n\nSETI@home was established in 1999\nWhile P2P systems had previously been used in many application domains,[3] the concept was popularized by file sharing systems such as the music-sharing application Napster (originally released in 1999). The peer-to-peer movement allowed millions of Internet users to connect \"directly, forming groups and collaborating to become user-created search engines, virtual supercomputers, and filesystems.\"[5] The basic concept of peer-to-peer computing was envisioned in earlier software systems and networking discussions, reaching back to principles stated in the first Request for Comments, RFC 1.[6]\n\nTim Berners-Lee's vision for the World Wide Web was close to a P2P network in that it assumed each user of the web would be an active editor and contributor, creating and linking content to form an interlinked \"web\" of links. The early Internet was more open than present day, where two machines connected to the Internet could send packets to each other without firewalls and other security measures.[5][page needed] This contrasts to the broadcasting-like structure of the web as it has developed over the years.[7][8] As a precursor to the Internet, ARPANET was a successful client–server network where \"every participating node could request and serve content.\" However, ARPANET was not self-organized, and it lacked the ability to \"provide any means for context or content-based routing beyond 'simple' address-based routing.\"[8]\n\nTherefore, Usenet, a distributed messaging system that is often described as an early peer-to-peer architecture, was established. It was developed in 1979 as a system that enforces a decentralized model of control.[9] The basic model is a client–server model from the user or client perspective that offers a self-organizing approach to newsgroup servers. However, news servers communicate with one another as peers to propagate Usenet news articles over the entire group of network servers. The same consideration applies to SMTP email in the sense that the core email-relaying network of mail transfer agents has a peer-to-peer character, while the periphery of Email clients and their direct connections is strictly a client–server relationship.[citation needed]\n\nIn May 1999, with millions more people on the Internet, Shawn Fanning introduced the music and file-sharing application called Napster.[8] Napster was the beginning of peer-to-peer networks, as we know them today, where \"participating users establish a virtual network, entirely independent from the physical network, without having to obey any administrative authorities or restrictions.\"[8]\n\nArchitecture\nA peer-to-peer network is designed around the notion of equal peer nodes simultaneously functioning as both \"clients\" and \"servers\" to the other nodes on the network. This model of network arrangement differs from the client–server model where communication is usually to and from a central server. A typical example of a file transfer that uses the client–server model is the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) service in which the client and server programs are distinct: the clients initiate the transfer, and the servers satisfy these requests.\n\nRouting and resource discovery\nPeer-to-peer networks generally implement some form of virtual overlay network on top of the physical network topology, where the nodes in the overlay form a subset of the nodes in the physical network. Data is still exchanged directly over the underlying TCP/IP network, but at the application layer peers are able to communicate with each other directly, via the logical overlay links (each of which corresponds to a path through the underlying physical network). Overlays are used for indexing and peer discovery, and make the P2P system independent from the physical network topology. Based on how the nodes are linked to each other within the overlay network, and how resources are indexed and located, we can classify networks as unstructured or structured (or as a hybrid between the two).[10][11][12]\n\nUnstructured networks\n\nOverlay network diagram for an unstructured P2P network, illustrating the ad hoc nature of the connections between nodes\nUnstructured peer-to-peer networks do not impose a particular structure on the overlay network by design, but rather are formed by nodes that randomly form connections to each other.[13] (Gnutella, Gossip, and Kazaa are examples of unstructured P2P protocols).[14]\n\nBecause there is no structure globally imposed upon them, unstructured networks are easy to build and allow for localized optimizations to different regions of the overlay.[15] Also, because the role of all peers in the network is the same, unstructured networks are highly robust in the face of high rates of \"churn\"—that is, when large numbers of peers are frequently joining and leaving the network.[16][17]\n\nHowever, the primary limitations of unstructured networks also arise from this lack of structure. In particular, when a peer wants to find a desired piece of data in the network, the search query must be flooded through the network to find as many peers as possible that share the data. Flooding causes a very high amount of signaling traffic in the network, uses more CPU/memory (by requiring every peer to process all search queries), and does not ensure that search queries will always be resolved. Furthermore, since there is no correlation between a peer and the content managed by it, there is no guarantee that flooding will find a peer that has the desired data. Popular content is likely to be available at several peers and any peer searching for it is likely to find the same thing. But if a peer is looking for rare data shared by only a few other peers, then it is highly unlikely that search will be successful.[18]\n\nStructured networks\n\nOverlay network diagram for a structured P2P network, using a distributed hash table (DHT) to identify and locate nodes/resources\nIn structured peer-to-peer networks the overlay is organized into a specific topology, and the protocol ensures that any node can efficiently[19] search the network for a file/resource, even if the resource is extremely rare.\n\nThe most common type of structured P2P networks implement a distributed hash table (DHT),[20][21] in which a variant of consistent hashing is used to assign ownership of each file to a particular peer.[22][23] This enables peers to search for resources on the network using a hash table: that is, (key, value) pairs are stored in the DHT, and any participating node can efficiently retrieve the value associated with a given key.[24][25]\n\n\nDistributed hash tables\nHowever, in order to route traffic efficiently through the network, nodes in a structured overlay must maintain lists of neighbors[26] that satisfy specific criteria. This makes them less robust in networks with a high rate of churn (i.e. with large numbers of nodes frequently joining and leaving the network).[17][27] More recent evaluation of P2P resource discovery solutions under real workloads have pointed out several issues in DHT-based solutions such as high cost of advertising/discovering resources and static and dynamic load imbalance.[28]\n\nNotable distributed networks that use DHTs include Tixati, an alternative to BitTorrent's distributed tracker, the Kad network, the Storm botnet, YaCy, and the Coral Content Distribution Network. Some prominent research projects include the Chord project, Kademlia, PAST storage utility, P-Grid, a self-organized and emerging overlay network, and CoopNet content distribution system.[29] DHT-based networks have also been widely utilized for accomplishing efficient resource discovery[30][31] for grid computing systems, as it aids in resource management and scheduling of applications.\n\nHybrid models\nHybrid models are a combination of peer-to-peer and client–server models.[32] A common hybrid model is to have a central server that helps peers find each other. Spotify was an example of a hybrid model [until 2014]. There are a variety of hybrid models, all of which make trade-offs between the centralized functionality provided by a structured server/client network and the node equality afforded by the pure peer-to-peer unstructured networks. Currently, hybrid models have better performance than either pure unstructured networks or pure structured networks because certain functions, such as searching, do require a centralized functionality but benefit from the decentralized aggregation of nodes provided by unstructured networks.[33]\n\nCoopNet content distribution system\nCoopNet (Cooperative Networking) was a proposed system for off-loading serving to peers who have recently downloaded content, proposed by computer scientists Venkata N. Padmanabhan and Kunwadee Sripanidkulchai, working at Microsoft Research and Carnegie Mellon University.[34][35] When a server experiences an increase in load it redirects incoming peers to other peers who have agreed to mirror the content, thus off-loading balance from the server. All of the information is retained at the server. This system makes use of the fact that the bottle-neck is most likely in the outgoing bandwidth than the CPU, hence its server-centric design. It assigns peers to other peers who are 'close in IP' to its neighbors [same prefix range] in an attempt to use locality. If multiple peers are found with the same file it designates that the node choose the fastest of its neighbors. Streaming media is transmitted by having clients cache the previous stream, and then transmit it piece-wise to new nodes.\n\nSecurity and trust\nPeer-to-peer systems pose unique challenges from a computer security perspective.\n\nLike any other form of software, P2P applications can contain vulnerabilities. What makes this particularly dangerous for P2P software, however, is that peer-to-peer applications act as servers as well as clients, meaning that they can be more vulnerable to remote exploits.[36]\n\nRouting attacks\nSince each node plays a role in routing traffic through the network, malicious users can perform a variety of \"routing attacks\", or denial of service attacks. Examples of common routing attacks include \"incorrect lookup routing\" whereby malicious nodes deliberately forward requests incorrectly or return false results, \"incorrect routing updates\" where malicious nodes corrupt the routing tables of neighboring nodes by sending them false information, and \"incorrect routing network partition\" where when new nodes are joining they bootstrap via a malicious node, which places the new node in a partition of the network that is populated by other malicious nodes.[37]\n\nCorrupted data and malware\nSee also: Data validation and Malware\nThe prevalence of malware varies between different peer-to-peer protocols. Studies analyzing the spread of malware on P2P networks found, for example, that 63% of the answered download requests on the gnutella network contained some form of malware, whereas only 3% of the content on OpenFT contained malware. In both cases, the top three most common types of malware accounted for the large majority of cases (99% in gnutella, and 65% in OpenFT). Another study analyzing traffic on the Kazaa network found that 15% of the 500,000 file sample taken were infected by one or more of the 365 different computer viruses that were tested for.[38]\n\nCorrupted data can also be distributed on P2P networks by modifying files that are already being shared on the network. For example, on the FastTrack network, the RIAA managed to introduce faked chunks into downloads and downloaded files (mostly MP3 files). Files infected with the RIAA virus were unusable afterwards and contained malicious code. The RIAA is also known to have uploaded fake music and movies to P2P networks in order to deter illegal file sharing.[39] Consequently, the P2P networks of today have seen an enormous increase of their security and file verification mechanisms. Modern hashing, chunk verification and different encryption methods have made most networks resistant to almost any type of attack, even when major parts of the respective network have been replaced by faked or nonfunctional hosts.[40]\n\nResilient and scalable computer networks\nSee also: Wireless mesh network and Distributed computing\nThe decentralized nature of P2P networks increases robustness because it removes the single point of failure that can be inherent in a client–server based system.[41] As nodes arrive and demand on the system increases, the total capacity of the system also increases, and the likelihood of failure decreases. If one peer on the network fails to function properly, the whole network is not compromised or damaged. In contrast, in a typical client–server architecture, clients share only their demands with the system, but not their resources. In this case, as more clients join the system, fewer resources are available to serve each client, and if the central server fails, the entire network is taken down.\n\nDistributed storage and search\n\nSearch results for the query \"software libre\", using YaCy a free distributed search engine that runs on a peer-to-peer network instead making requests to centralized index servers (like Google, Yahoo, and other corporate search engines)\nThere are both advantages and disadvantages in P2P networks related to the topic of data backup, recovery, and availability. In a centralized network, the system administrators are the only forces controlling the availability of files being shared. If the administrators decide to no longer distribute a file, they simply have to remove it from their servers, and it will no longer be available to users. Along with leaving the users powerless in deciding what is distributed throughout the community, this makes the entire system vulnerable to threats and requests from the government and other large forces. For example, YouTube has been pressured by the RIAA, MPAA, and entertainment industry to filter out copyrighted content. Although server-client networks are able to monitor and manage content availability, they can have more stability in the availability of the content they choose to host. A client should not have trouble accessing obscure content that is being shared on a stable centralized network. P2P networks, however, are more unreliable in sharing unpopular files because sharing files in a P2P network requires that at least one node in the network has the requested data, and that node must be able to connect to the node requesting the data. This requirement is occasionally hard to meet because users may delete or stop sharing data at any point.[42]\n\nIn this sense, the community of users in a P2P network is completely responsible for deciding what content is available. Unpopular files will eventually disappear and become unavailable as more people stop sharing them. Popular files, however, will be highly and easily distributed. Popular files on a P2P network actually have more stability and availability than files on central networks. In a centralized network, a simple loss of connection between the server and clients is enough to cause a failure, but in P2P networks, the connections between every node must be lost in order to cause a data sharing failure. In a centralized system, the administrators are responsible for all data recovery and backups, while in P2P systems, each node requires its own backup system. Because of the lack of central authority in P2P networks, forces such as the recording industry, RIAA, MPAA, and the government are unable to delete or stop the sharing of content on P2P systems.[43]\n\nApplications\n\nThis article is in list format, but may read better as prose. You can help by converting this article, if appropriate. Editing help is available. (September 2014)\nContent delivery\nIn P2P networks, clients both provide and use resources. This means that unlike client–server systems, the content-serving capacity of peer-to-peer networks can actually increase as more users begin to access the content (especially with protocols such as Bittorrent that require users to share, refer a performance measurement study[44]). This property is one of the major advantages of using P2P networks because it makes the setup and running costs very small for the original content distributor.[45][46]\n\nFile-sharing networks\nMany file peer-to-peer file sharing networks, such as Gnutella, G2, and the eDonkey network popularized peer-to-peer technologies.\n\nPeer-to-peer content delivery networks.\nPeer-to-peer content services, e.g. caches for improved performance such as Correli Caches[47]\nSoftware publication and distribution (Linux distribution, several games); via file sharing networks.\nCopyright infringements\nPeer-to-peer networking involves data transfer from one user to another without using an intermediate server. Companies developing P2P applications have been involved in numerous legal cases, primarily in the United States, over conflicts with copyright law.[48] Two major cases are Grokster vs RIAA and MGM Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd..[49] In the last case, the Court unanimously held that defendant peer-to-peer file sharing companies Grokster and Streamcast could be sued for inducing copyright infringement.\n\nMultimedia\nThe P2PTV and PDTP protocols.\nSome proprietary multimedia applications use a peer-to-peer network along with streaming servers to stream audio and video to their clients.\nPeercasting for multicasting streams.\nPennsylvania State University, MIT and Simon Fraser University are carrying on a project called LionShare designed for facilitating file sharing among educational institutions globally.\nOsiris is a program that allows its users to create anonymous and autonomous web portals distributed via P2P network.\nThe Theta Network is a cryptocurrency token platform that enables peer-to-peer streaming and CDN caching.[50][51][52]\nOther P2P applications\n\nTorrent file connect peers\nBitcoin and alternatives such as Ether, Nxt and Peercoin are peer-to-peer-based digital cryptocurrencies.\nDalesa, a peer-to-peer web cache for LANs (based on IP multicasting).\nDat, a distributed version-controlled publishing platform.\nFilecoin is an open source, public, cryptocurrency and digital payment system intended to be a blockchain-based cooperative digital storage and data retrieval method.\nI2P, an overlay network used to browse the Internet anonymously.\nUnlike the related I2P, the Tor network is not itself peer-to-peer; however, it can enable peer-to-peer applications to be built on top of it via onion services.\nThe InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is a protocol and network designed to create a content-addressable, peer-to-peer method of storing and sharing hypermedia distribution protocol.

According to Microsoft's Channel 9 it led to a 30%-50% reduction in Internet bandwidth usage.[54]\nArtisoft's LANtastic was built as a peer-to-peer operating system. Machines can be servers and workstations at the same time.\nSocial implications\nSee also: Social peer-to-peer processes\nIncentivizing resource sharing and cooperation\nFurther information: Uberisation\n\nThe BitTorrent protocol: In this animation, the colored bars beneath all of the 7 clients in the upper region above represent the file being shared, with each color representing an individual piece of the file. After the initial pieces transfer from the seed (large system at the bottom), the pieces are individually transferred from client to client. The original seeder only needs to send out one copy of the file for all the clients to receive a copy.\nCooperation among a community of participants is key to the continued success of P2P systems aimed at casual human users; these reach their full potential only when large numbers of nodes contribute resources. But in current practice, P2P networks often contain large numbers of users who utilize resources shared by other nodes, but who do not share anything themselves (often referred to as the \"freeloader problem\"). Freeloading can have a profound impact on the network and in some cases can cause the community to collapse.[55] In these types of networks \"users have natural disincentives to cooperate because cooperation consumes their own resources and may degrade their own performance.\"[56] Studying the social attributes of P2P networks is challenging due to large populations of turnover, asymmetry of interest and zero-cost identity.[56] A variety of incentive mechanisms have been implemented to encourage or even force nodes to contribute resources.[57]\n\nSome researchers have explored the benefits of enabling virtual communities to self-organize and introduce incentives for resource sharing and cooperation, arguing that the social aspect missing from today's P2P systems should be seen both as a goal and a means for self-organized virtual communities to be built and fostered.[58] Ongoing research efforts for designing effective incentive mechanisms in P2P systems, based on principles from game theory, are beginning to take on a more psychological and information-processing direction.\n\nPrivacy and anonymity\nSome peer-to-peer networks (e.g. Freenet) place a heavy emphasis on privacy and anonymity—that is, ensuring that the contents of communications are hidden from eavesdroppers, and that the identities/locations of the participants are concealed. Public key cryptography can be used to provide encryption, data validation, authorization, and authentication for data/messages. Onion routing and other mix network protocols (e.g. Tarzan) can be used to provide anonymity.[59]\n\nPerpetrators of live streaming sexual abuse and other cybercrimes have used peer-to-peer platforms to carry out activities with anonymity.[60]\n\nPolitical implications\nIntellectual property law and illegal sharing\nAlthough peer-to-peer networks can be used for legitimate purposes, rights holders have targeted peer-to-peer over the involvement with sharing copyrighted material. Peer-to-peer networking involves data transfer from one user to another without using an intermediate server. Companies developing P2P applications have been involved in numerous legal cases, primarily in the United States, primarily over issues surrounding copyright law.[48] Two major cases are Grokster vs RIAA and MGM Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd.[49] In both of the cases the file sharing technology was ruled to be legal as long as the developers had no ability to prevent the sharing of the copyrighted material. To establish criminal liability for the copyright infringement on peer-to-peer systems, the government must prove that the defendant infringed a copyright willingly for the purpose of personal financial gain or commercial advantage.[61] Fair use exceptions allow limited use of copyrighted material to be downloaded without acquiring permission from the rights holders. These documents are usually news reporting or under the lines of research and scholarly work. Controversies have developed over the concern of illegitimate use of peer-to-peer networks regarding public safety and national security. When a file is downloaded through a peer-to-peer network, it is impossible to know who created the file or what users are connected to the network at a given time. Trustworthiness of sources is a potential security threat that can be seen with peer-to-peer systems.[62]\n\nA study ordered by the European Union found that illegal downloading may lead to an increase in overall video game sales because newer games charge for extra features or levels. The paper concluded that piracy had a negative financial impact on movies, music, and literature. The study relied on self-reported data about game purchases and use of illegal download sites. Pains were taken to remove effects of false and misremembered responses.[63][64][65]\n\nNetwork neutrality\nPeer-to-peer applications present one of the core issues in the network neutrality controversy. Internet service providers (ISPs) have been known to throttle P2P file-sharing traffic due to its high-bandwidth usage.[66] Compared to Web browsing, e-mail or many other uses of the internet, where data is only transferred in short intervals and relative small quantities, P2P file-sharing often consists of relatively heavy bandwidth usage due to ongoing file transfers and swarm/network coordination packets. In October 2007, Comcast, one of the largest broadband Internet providers in the United States, started blocking P2P applications such as BitTorrent. Their rationale was that P2P is mostly used to share illegal content, and their infrastructure is not designed for continuous, high-bandwidth traffic. Critics point out that P2P networking has legitimate legal uses, and that this is another way that large providers are trying to control use and content on the Internet, and direct people towards a client–server-based application architecture. The client–server model provides financial barriers-to-entry to small publishers and individuals, and can be less efficient for sharing large files. As a reaction to this bandwidth throttling, several P2P applications started implementing protocol obfuscation, such as the BitTorrent protocol encryption. Techniques for achieving \"protocol obfuscation\" involves removing otherwise easily identifiable properties of protocols, such as deterministic byte sequences and packet sizes, by making the data look as if it were random.[67] The ISP's solution to the high bandwidth is P2P caching, where an ISP stores the part of files most accessed by P2P clients in order to save access to the Internet.\n\nCurrent research\nResearchers have used computer simulations to aid in understanding and evaluating the complex behaviors of individuals within the network. \"Networking research often relies on simulation in order to test and evaluate new ideas. An important requirement of this process is that results must be reproducible so that other researchers can replicate, validate, and extend existing work.\"[68] If the research cannot be reproduced, then the opportunity for further research is hindered. \"Even though new simulators continue to be released, the research community tends towards only a handful of open-source simulators. The demand for features in simulators, as shown by our criteria and survey, is high. Therefore, the community should work together to get these features in open-source software. This would reduce the need for custom simulators, and hence increase repeatability and reputability of experiments.\"[68]\n\nBesides all the above stated facts, there have been work done on ns-2 open source network simulator. One research issue related to free rider detection and punishment has been explored using ns-2 simulator here.[69]",

          "context": "Bitcoin network\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\nJump to navigationJump to search\nFor broader coverage of this topic, see Bitcoin.\n\nA diagram of a bitcoin transfer\n\nNumber of bitcoin transactions per month (logarithmic scale)[1]\nThe bitcoin network is a peer-to-peer payment network that operates on a cryptographic protocol. Users send and receive bitcoins, the units of currency, by broadcasting digitally signed messages to the network using bitcoin cryptocurrency wallet software. Transactions are recorded into a distributed, replicated public database known as the blockchain, with consensus achieved by a proof-of-work system called mining. Satoshi Nakamoto, the designer of bitcoin, claimed that design and coding of bitcoin began in 2007. The project was released in 2009 as open source software.\n\nThe network requires minimal structure to share transactions. An ad hoc decentralized network of volunteers is sufficient. Messages are broadcast on a best-effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will. Upon reconnection, a node downloads and verifies new blocks from other nodes to complete its local copy of the blockchain.[2][3]\n\n\nContents\n1\tTransactions\n2\tMining\n2.1\tDifficulty and mining pools\n2.2\tEnergy sources and consumption\n2.3\tProcess\n2.4\tMined bitcoins\n3\tSecurity\n3.1\tUnauthorized spending\n3.2\tDouble spending\n3.3\tRace attack\n3.4\tHistory modification\n3.5\tDeanonymisation of clients\n4\tPayment verification\n5\tData in the blockchain\n6\tAlleged criminal activity\n6.1\tBlack markets\n6.2\tMoney laundering\n6.3\tPonzi scheme\n7\tSee also\n8\tReferences\nTransactions\n\nAn actual bitcoin transaction including the fee from a web-based cryptocurrency exchange to a hardware wallet.\n\nThe best chain   consists of the longest series of transaction records from the genesis block   to the current block or record. Orphaned records   exist outside of the best chain.\nA bitcoin is defined by a sequence of digitally signed transactions that began with the bitcoin's creation, as a block reward. The owner of a bitcoin transfers it by digitally signing it over to the next owner using a bitcoin transaction, much like endorsing a traditional bank check. A payee can examine each previous transaction to verify the chain of ownership. Unlike traditional check endorsements, bitcoin transactions are irreversible, which eliminates risk of chargeback fraud.\n\nAlthough it is possible to handle bitcoins individually, it would be unwieldy to require a separate transaction for every bitcoin in a transaction. Transactions are therefore allowed to contain multiple inputs and outputs, allowing bitcoins to be split and combined. Common transactions will have either a single input from a larger previous transaction or multiple inputs combining smaller amounts, and one or two outputs: one for the payment, and one returning the change, if any, to the sender. Any difference between the total input and output amounts of a transaction goes to miners as a transaction fee.[2]\n\nMining\n\nGPU-based mining rig, 2012\n\nA Bitcoin mining farm, 2018\nTo form a distributed timestamp server as a peer-to-peer network, bitcoin uses a proof-of-work system.[3] This work is often called bitcoin mining.\n\nRequiring a proof of work to accept a new block to the blockchain was Satoshi Nakamoto's key innovation. The mining process involves identifying a block that, when hashed twice with SHA-256, yields a number smaller than the given difficulty target. While the average work required increases in inverse proportion to the difficulty target, a hash can always be verified by executing a single round of double SHA-256.\n\nFor the bitcoin timestamp network, a valid proof of work is found by incrementing a nonce until a value is found that gives the block's hash the required number of leading zero bits. Once the hashing has produced a valid result, the block cannot be changed without redoing the work. As later blocks are chained after it, the work to change the block would include redoing the work for each subsequent block. If there is a deviation in consensus then a blockchain fork can occur.\n\nMajority consensus in bitcoin is represented by the longest chain, which required the greatest amount of effort to produce. If a majority of computing power is controlled by honest nodes, the honest chain will grow fastest and outpace any competing chains. To modify a past block, an attacker would have to redo the proof-of-work of that block and all blocks after it and then surpass the work of the honest nodes. The probability of a slower attacker catching up diminishes exponentially as subsequent blocks are added.[3]\n\n\nMining difficulty has increased significantly\nTo compensate for increasing hardware speed and varying interest in running nodes over time, the difficulty of finding a valid hash is adjusted roughly every two weeks. If blocks are generated too quickly, the difficulty increases and more hashes are required to make a block and to generate new bitcoins.[3]\n\nDifficulty and mining pools\nFurther information: Mining pool\n\nThe largest Bitcoin mining pools as of April 2020 by nation they're based[clarification needed] in\nBitcoin mining is a competitive endeavor. An \"arms race\" has been observed through the various hashing technologies that have been used to mine bitcoins: basic central processing units (CPUs), high-end graphics processing units (GPUs), field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) all have been used, each reducing the profitability of the less-specialized technology. Bitcoin-specific ASICs are now the primary method of mining bitcoin and have surpassed GPU speed by as much as 300-fold. The difficulty within the mining process involves self-adjusting to the network's accumulated mining power. As bitcoins have become more difficult to mine, computer hardware manufacturing companies have seen an increase in sales of high-end ASIC products.[4]\n\nComputing power is often bundled together or \"pooled\" to reduce variance in miner income. Individual mining rigs often have to wait for long periods to confirm a block of transactions and receive payment. In a pool, all participating miners get paid every time a participating server solves a block. This payment depends on the amount of work an individual miner contributed to help find that block.[5]\n\nEnergy sources and consumption\n\nBitcoin electricity consumption as of 2021[6]\nIn 2013, Mark Gimein estimated electricity consumption to be about 40.9 megawatts (982 megawatt-hours a day).[7] In 2014, Hass McCook estimated 80.7 megawatts (80,666 kW). As of 2015, The Economist estimated that even if all miners used modern facilities, the combined electricity consumption would be 166.7 megawatts (1.46 terawatt-hours per year).[8] The Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index estimates the energy use of the bitcoin network grew from 1.95 terawatt-hours per year at the end of 2014, to 77.1 terawatt-hours per year by the end of 2019.[6]\n\nSeeking lower electricity costs, some bitcoin miners have set up in places like Iceland where geothermal energy is cheap and cooling Arctic air is free.[9] Chinese bitcoin miners are known to use hydroelectric power in Tibet to reduce electricity costs.[10] North American companies are utilizing stranded gas as a cost-effective source of energy for bitcoin mining.[11] In West Texas, wind powers bitcoin mining.[12] As of April 2021, at least one-third of Bitcoin mining was powered by coal in China's Xinjiang region.[13]\n\nA 2021 study found that carbon emissions from Bitcoin mining in China – where a majority of the proof-of-work algorithm that generates current economic value is computed – have accelerated rapidly, are largely fueled by nonrenewable sources and would soon exceed total annual emissions of countries like Italy and Spain during 2016, interfering with international climate change mitigation commitments.[14][15]\n\nProcess\n\nAvalon ASIC-based mining machine\nA rough overview of the process to mine bitcoins involves:[3]\n\nNew transactions are broadcast to all nodes.\nEach miner node collects new transactions into a block.\nEach miner node works on finding a proof-of-work code for its block.\nWhen a node finds a proof-of-work, it broadcasts the block to all nodes.\nReceiving nodes validate the transactions it holds and accept only if all are valid.\nNodes express their acceptance by moving to work on the next block, incorporating the hash of the accepted block.\nMined bitcoins\n\nDiagram showing how bitcoin transactions are verified\nBy convention, the first transaction in a block is a special transaction that produces new bitcoins owned by the creator of the block. This is the incentive for nodes to support the network.[2] It provides the way to move new bitcoins into circulation. The reward for mining halves every 210,000 blocks. It started at 50 bitcoin, dropped to 25 in late 2012 and to 12.5 bitcoin in 2016. The most recent halving, which occurred in May 2020 (with block number 630,000), reduced the block reward to 6.25 bitcoin. This halving process is programmed to continue a maximum 64 times before new coin creation ceases.[16]\n\nSecurity\nVarious potential attacks on the bitcoin network and its use as a payment system, real or theoretical, have been considered. The bitcoin protocol includes several features that protect it against some of those attacks, such as unauthorized spending, double spending, forging bitcoins, and tampering with the blockchain. Other attacks, such as theft of private keys, require due care by users.[17][18]\n\nUnauthorized spending\nUnauthorized spending is mitigated by bitcoin's implementation of public-private key cryptography. For example, when Alice sends a bitcoin to Bob, Bob becomes the new owner of the bitcoin. Eve, observing the transaction, might want to spend the bitcoin Bob just received, but she cannot sign the transaction without the knowledge of Bob's private key.[18]\n\nDouble spending\nA specific problem that an internet payment system must solve is double-spending, whereby a user pays the same coin to two or more different recipients. An example of such a problem would be if Eve sent a bitcoin to Alice and later sent the same bitcoin to Bob. The bitcoin network guards against double-spending by recording all bitcoin transfers in a ledger (the blockchain) that is visible to all users, and ensuring for all transferred bitcoins that they have not been previously spent.[18]:4\n\nRace attack\nIf Eve offers to pay Alice a bitcoin in exchange for goods and signs a corresponding transaction, it is still possible that she also creates a different transaction at the same time sending the same bitcoin to Bob. By the rules, the network accepts only one of the transactions. This is called a race attack, since there is a race which transaction will be accepted first. Alice can reduce the risk of race attack stipulating that she will not deliver the goods until Eve's payment to Alice appears in the blockchain.[19]\n\nA variant race attack (which has been called a Finney attack by reference to Hal Finney) requires the participation of a miner. Instead of sending both payment requests (to pay Bob and Alice with the same coins) to the network, Eve issues only Alice's payment request to the network, while the accomplice tries to mine a block that includes the payment to Bob instead of Alice. There is a positive probability that the rogue miner will succeed before the network, in which case the payment to Alice will be rejected. As with the plain race attack, Alice can reduce the risk of a Finney attack by waiting for the payment to be included in the blockchain.[20]\n\nHistory modification\nEach block that is added to the blockchain, starting with the block containing a given transaction, is called a confirmation of that transaction. Ideally, merchants and services that receive payment in bitcoin should wait for at least one confirmation to be distributed over the network, before assuming that the payment was done. The more confirmations that the merchant waits for, the more difficult it is for an attacker to successfully reverse the transaction in a blockchain—unless the attacker controls more than half the total network power, in which case it is called a 51% attack.[21]\n\nDeanonymisation of clients\nDeanonymisation is a strategy in data mining in which anonymous data is cross-referenced with other sources of data to re-identify the anonymous data source. Along with transaction graph analysis, which may reveal connections between bitcoin addresses (pseudonyms),[17][22] there is a possible attack[23] which links a user's pseudonym to its IP address. If the peer is using Tor, the attack includes a method to separate the peer from the Tor network, forcing them to use their real IP address for any further transactions. The attack makes use of bitcoin mechanisms of relaying peer addresses and anti-DoS protection. The cost of the attack on the full bitcoin network is under €1500 per month.[23]\n\nPayment verification\nMain article: Online transaction processing\nEach miner can choose which transactions are included in or exempted from a block.[24] A greater number of transactions in a block does not equate to greater computational power required to solve that block.[24]\n\nUpon receiving a new transaction a node must validate it: in particular, verify that none of the transaction's inputs have been previously spent. To carry out that check, the node needs to access the blockchain. Any user who does not trust his network neighbors, should keep a full local copy of the blockchain, so that any input can be verified.\n\nAs noted in Nakamoto's whitepaper, it is possible to verify bitcoin payments without running a full network node (simplified payment verification, SPV). A user only needs a copy of the block headers of the longest chain, which are available by querying network nodes until it is apparent that the longest chain has been obtained; then, get the Merkle tree branch linking the transaction to its block. Linking the transaction to a place in the chain demonstrates that a network node has accepted it, and blocks added after it further establish the confirmation.[2]\n\nData in the blockchain\nWhile it is possible to store any digital file in the blockchain, the larger the transaction size, the larger any associated fees become. Various items have been embedded, including URLs to websites, an ASCII art image of Ben Bernanke, material from the Wikileaks cables, prayers from bitcoin miners, and the original bitcoin whitepaper.[25]\n\nAlleged criminal activity\nFor broader coverage of this topic, see Cryptocurrency and security.\nThe use of bitcoin by criminals has attracted the attention of financial regulators, legislative bodies, law enforcement, and the media.[26] The FBI prepared an intelligence assessment,[27] the SEC has issued a pointed warning about investment schemes using virtual currencies,[26] and the U.S. Senate held a hearing on virtual currencies in November 2013.[28]\n\nSeveral news outlets have asserted that the popularity of bitcoins hinges on the ability to use them to purchase illegal goods.[29][30] In 2014, researchers at the University of Kentucky found \"robust evidence that computer programming enthusiasts and illegal activity drive interest in bitcoin, and find limited or no support for political and investment motives.\"[31]\n\nBlack markets\nMain article: Darknet market\nA Carnegie Mellon University researcher estimated that in 2012, 4.5% to 9% of all transactions on all exchanges in the world were for drug trades on a single dark web drugs market, Silk Road.[32] Child pornography,[33] murder-for-hire,[34] and weapons[35] are also allegedly available on black market sites that sell in bitcoin. Due to the anonymous nature and the lack of central control on these markets, it is hard to know whether the services are real or just trying to take the bitcoins.[36]\n\nSeveral deep web black markets have been shut by authorities. In October 2013 Silk Road was shut down by U.S. law enforcement,[37][38][39] leading to a short-term decrease in the value of bitcoin.[40] In 2015, the founder of the site was sentenced to life in prison.[41] Alternative sites were soon available, and in early 2014 the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported that the closure of Silk Road had little impact on the number of Australians selling drugs online, which had actually increased.[42] In early 2014, Dutch authorities closed Utopia, an online illegal goods market, and seized 900 bitcoins.[43] In late 2014, a joint police operation saw European and American authorities seize bitcoins and close 400 deep web sites including the illicit goods market Silk Road 2.0.[44] Law enforcement activity has resulted in several convictions. In December 2014, Charlie Shrem was sentenced to two years in prison for indirectly helping to send $1 million to the Silk Road drugs site,[45] and in February 2015, its founder, Ross Ulbricht, was convicted on drugs charges and given a sentence of double life imprisonment plus 40 years.[46]\n\nSome black market sites may seek to steal bitcoins from customers. The bitcoin community branded one site, Sheep Marketplace, as a scam when it prevented withdrawals and shut down after an alleged bitcoins theft.[47] In a separate case, escrow accounts with bitcoins belonging to patrons of a different black market were hacked in early 2014.[48]\n\nAccording to the Internet Watch Foundation, a UK-based charity, bitcoin is used to purchase child pornography, and almost 200 such websites accept it as payment. Bitcoin is not the sole way to purchase child pornography online, as Troels Oertling, head of the cybercrime unit at Europol, states, \"Ukash and paysafecard... have [also] been used to pay for such material.\" However, the Internet Watch Foundation lists around 30 sites that exclusively accept bitcoins.[33] Some of these sites have shut down, such as a deep web crowdfunding website that aimed to fund the creation of new child porn.[49][better source needed] Furthermore, hyperlinks to child porn websites have been added to the blockchain as arbitrary data can be included when a transaction is made.[50][51]\n\nMoney laundering\nBitcoins may not be ideal for money laundering, because all transactions are public.[52] Authorities—including the European Banking Authority,[53] the FBI,[27] South African Reserve Bank[citation needed] and the Financial Action Task Force of the G7[54]—have expressed concerns that bitcoin may be used for money laundering. In early 2014, an operator of a U.S. bitcoin exchange, Charlie Shrem, was arrested for money laundering.[55] Subsequently, he was sentenced to two years in prison for \"aiding and abetting an unlicensed money transmitting business\".[45] Alexander Vinnik, an alleged owner of BTC-e, was arrested in Greece on July 25, 2017, on $4 billion money laundering charges for flouting anti-money laundering (AML) laws of the US. A report by the UK's Treasury and Home Office named \"UK national risk assessment of money laundering and terrorist financing\" (October 2015) found that, of the twelve methods examined in the report, bitcoin carries the lowest risk of being used for money laundering, with the most common money laundering method being the banks.[56]\n\nPonzi scheme\nIn a Ponzi scheme using bitcoins, the Bitcoin Savings and Trust promised investors up to 7% weekly interest, and raised at least 700,000 bitcoins from 2011 to 2012.[57] In July 2013, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charged the company and its founder in 2013 \"with defrauding investors in a Ponzi scheme involving bitcoin\".[57] In September 2014 the judge fined Bitcoin Savings & Trust and its owner $40 million.[58]",

          "context": "Satoshi Nakamoto\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\nJump to navigationJump to search\nSatoshi Nakamoto\nBorn\t5 April 1975 (age 46) (claimed)\nJapan (claimed)\nNationality\tJapanese (claimed)\nKnown for\tInventing bitcoin, implementing the first blockchain\nScientific career\nFields\tDigital currencies, computer science, cryptography\nSatoshi Nakamoto is the name used by the presumed pseudonymous[1][2][3][4] person or persons who developed bitcoin, authored the bitcoin white paper, and created and deployed bitcoin's original reference implementation.[5] As part of the implementation, Nakamoto also devised the first blockchain database.[6] Nakamoto was active in the development of bitcoin up until December 2010.[7] Many people have claimed, or have been claimed, to be Nakamoto.\n\n\nContents\n1\tDevelopment of bitcoin\n2\tCharacteristics and identity\n2.1\tPossible identities\n2.2\tHal Finney\n2.3\tDorian Satoshi Nakamoto\n2.4\tNick Szabo\n2.5\tCraig Wright\n2.6\tOther candidates\n3\tReferences\n4\tExternal links\nDevelopment of bitcoin\nNakamoto stated that work on the writing of the code for bitcoin began in 2007.[8] On 18 August 2008, he or a colleague registered the domain name bitcoin.org,[9] and created a web site at that address. On 31 October, Nakamoto published a white paper on the cryptography mailing list at metzdowd.com describing a digital cryptocurrency, titled \"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System\".[10][11][12]\n\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto message embedded in the coinbase of the first block\nOn 9 January 2009, Nakamoto released version 0.1 of the bitcoin software on SourceForge, and launched the network by defining the genesis block of bitcoin (block number 0), which had a reward of 50 bitcoins.[13][14][15][16] Embedded in the coinbase transaction of this block is the text: \"The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks\",[17] citing a headline in the UK newspaper The Times published on that date.[18] This note has been interpreted as both a timestamp and a derisive comment on the instability caused by fractional-reserve banking.[19]:18\n\nNakamoto continued to collaborate with other developers on the bitcoin software until mid-2010, making all modifications to the source code himself. He then gave control of the source code repository and network alert key to Gavin Andresen,[20] transferred several related domains to various prominent members of the bitcoin community, and stopped his recognized involvement in the project.[citation needed]\n\nIn 2021 a monument was announced in honor of Nakamoto in Budapest, Hungary for his work on Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.[21]\n\nCharacteristics and identity\nNakamoto has never revealed personal information when discussing technical matters,[22] though has at times provided commentary on banking and fractional-reserve banking. On his P2P Foundation profile as of 2012, Nakamoto claimed to be a 37-year-old male who lived in Japan;[23] however, some speculated he was unlikely to be Japanese due to his native-level use of English.[22]\n\nSome have considered that Nakamoto might be a team of people: Dan Kaminsky, a security researcher who read the bitcoin code,[24] said that Nakamoto could either be a \"team of people\" or a \"genius\";[25] Laszlo Hanyecz, a developer who had emailed Nakamoto, had the feeling the code was too well designed for one person;[22] Gavin Andresen has said of Nakamoto's code: \"He was a brilliant coder, but it was quirky.\"[26]\n\nThe use of British English in both source code comments and forum postings – such as the expression \"bloody hard\", terms such as \"flat\" and \"maths\", and the spellings \"grey\" and \"colour\"[17] – led to speculation that Nakamoto, or at least one individual in a consortium claiming to be him, was of Commonwealth origin.[22][10][25] The reference to London's Times newspaper in the first bitcoin block mined by Nakamoto suggested to some a particular interest in the British government.[17][27]:18\n\nStefan Thomas, a Swiss software engineer and active community member, graphed the timestamps for each of Nakamoto's bitcoin forum posts (more than 500); the chart showed a steep decline to almost no posts between the hours of 5 a.m. and 11 a.m. Greenwich Mean Time. This was between 2 p.m. and 8 p.m. Japan Standard Time, suggesting an unusual sleep pattern for someone supposedly living in Japan. As this pattern held true even on Saturdays and Sundays, it suggested that Nakamoto consistently was asleep at this time.[22]\n\nPossible identities\nThe identity of Nakamoto is unknown,[28] but speculations have focussed on various cryptography and computer science experts, mostly of non-Japanese descent.[22]\n\nHal Finney\nHal Finney (4 May 1956 – 28 August 2014) was a pre-bitcoin cryptographic pioneer and the first person (other than Nakamoto himself) to use the software, file bug reports, and make improvements.[29] He also lived a few blocks from a man named 'Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto', according to Forbes journalist Andy Greenberg.[30] Greenberg asked the writing analysis consultancy Juola & Associates to compare a sample of Finney's writing to Nakamoto's, and found it to be the closest resemblance they had yet come across, including when compared to candidates suggested by Newsweek, Fast Company, The New Yorker, Ted Nelson and Skye Grey.[30] Greenberg theorized that Finney may have been a ghostwriter on behalf of Nakamoto, or that he simply used his neighbor Dorian's identity as a \"drop\" or \"patsy whose personal information is used to hide online exploits\". However, after meeting Finney, seeing the emails between him and Nakamoto and his bitcoin wallet's history (including the very first bitcoin transaction from Nakamoto to him, which he forgot to pay back) and hearing his denial, Greenberg concluded that Finney was telling the truth. Juola & Associates also found that Nakamoto's emails to Finney more closely resemble Nakamoto's other writings than Finney's do. Finney's fellow extropian and sometimes co-blogger Robin Hanson assigned a subjective probability of \"at least\" 15% that \"Hal was more involved than he's said\", before further evidence suggested that was not the case.[31]\n\nDorian Satoshi Nakamoto\nIn a high-profile 6 March 2014 article in the magazine Newsweek,[32] journalist Leah McGrath Goodman identified Dorian Prentice Satoshi Nakamoto, a Japanese American man living in California, whose birth name is Satoshi Nakamoto,[32][33][34] as the Nakamoto in question. Besides his name, Goodman pointed to a number of facts that circumstantially suggested he was the bitcoin inventor.[32] Trained as a physicist at Cal Poly University in Pomona, Nakamoto worked as a systems engineer on classified defense projects and computer engineer for technology and financial information services companies. Nakamoto was laid off twice in the early 1990s and turned libertarian, according to his daughter, and encouraged her to start her own business \"not under the government's thumb.\" In the article's seemingly biggest piece of evidence, Goodman wrote that when she asked him about bitcoin during a brief in-person interview, Nakamoto seemed to confirm his identity as the bitcoin founder by stating: \"I am no longer involved in that and I cannot discuss it. It's been turned over to other people. They are in charge of it now. I no longer have any connection.\"[32][35]\n\nThe article's publication led to a flurry of media interest, including reporters camping out near Dorian Nakamoto's house and subtly chasing him by car when he drove to do an interview.[36] However, during the subsequent full-length interview, Dorian Nakamoto denied all connection to bitcoin, saying he had never heard of the currency before, and that he had misinterpreted Goodman's question as being about his previous work for military contractors, much of which was classified.[37] In a Reddit \"ask-me-anything\" interview, he claimed he had misinterpreted Goodman's question as being related to his work for Citibank.[38] Later that day, the pseudonymous Nakamoto's P2P Foundation account posted its first message in five years, stating: \"I am not Dorian Nakamoto.\"[39][40] In September, the account posted another message saying it had been hacked, raising questions over the earlier message's authenticity.[41][42]\n\nNick Szabo\nIn December 2013, blogger Skye Grey linked Nick Szabo to the bitcoin white paper using an approach he described as stylometric analysis.[43][44][45] Szabo is a decentralized currency enthusiast, and had published a paper on \"bit gold\", one of the precursors of bitcoin. He is known to have been interested in using pseudonyms in the 1990s.[46] In a May 2011 article, Szabo stated about the bitcoin creator: \"Myself, Wei Dai, and Hal Finney were the only people I know of who liked the idea (or in Dai's case his related idea) enough to pursue it to any significant extent until Nakamoto (assuming Nakamoto is not really Finney or Dai).\"[47]\n\nFinancial author Dominic Frisby provides much circumstantial evidence but, as he admits, no proof that Nakamoto is Szabo.[48] However, Szabo has denied being Nakamoto. In a July 2014 email to Frisby, he said: \"Thanks for letting me know. I'm afraid you got it wrong doxing me as Satoshi, but I'm used to it.\"[49] Nathaniel Popper wrote in the New York Times that \"the most convincing evidence pointed to a reclusive American man of Hungarian descent named Nick Szabo.\"[50]\n\nCraig Wright\nSee also: Craig Steven Wright § Bitcoin\nOn 8 December 2015, Wired wrote that Craig Steven Wright, an Australian academic, \"either invented bitcoin or is a brilliant hoaxer who very badly wants us to believe he did\".[51] Craig Wright took down his Twitter account and neither he nor his ex-wife responded to press inquiries. The same day, Gizmodo published a story with evidence supposedly obtained by a hacker who broke into Wright's email accounts, claiming that Satoshi Nakamoto was a joint pseudonym for Craig Steven Wright and computer forensics analyst David Kleiman, who died in 2013.[52] Wright's claim was supported by Jon Matonis (former director of the Bitcoin Foundation) and bitcoin developer Gavin Andresen.[53]\n\nA number of prominent bitcoin promoters remained unconvinced by the reports.[54] Subsequent reports also raised the possibility that the evidence provided was an elaborate hoax,[55][56] which Wired acknowledged \"cast doubt\" on their suggestion that Wright was Nakamoto.[57] Bitcoin developer Peter Todd said that Wright's blog post, which appeared to contain cryptographic proof, actually contained nothing of the sort.[58] Bitcoin developer Jeff Garzik agreed that evidence publicly provided by Wright does not prove anything, and security researcher Dan Kaminsky concluded Wright's claim was \"intentional scammery\".[59]\n\nIn May 2019, Wright started using UK libel law to sue people who denied he was the inventor of bitcoin, and who called him a fraud.[60]\n\nIn 2019 Wright registered US copyright for the bitcoin white paper and the code for Bitcoin 0.1.[61] Wright's team claimed this was \"government agency recognition of Craig Wright as Satoshi Nakamoto\";[62] the United States Copyright Office issued a press release clarifying that this was not the case.[63]\n\nOther candidates\nIn a 2011 article in The New Yorker, Joshua Davis claimed to have narrowed down the identity of Nakamoto to a number of possible individuals, including the Finnish economic sociologist Dr. Vili Lehdonvirta and Irish student Michael Clear, who was in 2008 an undergraduate student in cryptography at Trinity College Dublin.[64] Clear strongly denied he was Nakamoto,[65] as did Lehdonvirta.[64]\n\nIn October 2011, writing for Fast Company, investigative journalist Adam Penenberg cited circumstantial evidence suggesting Neal King, Vladimir Oksman and Charles Bry could be Nakamoto.[66] They jointly filed a patent application that contained the phrase \"computationally impractical to reverse\" in 2008, which was also used in the bitcoin white paper by Nakamoto.[67] The domain name bitcoin.org was registered three days after the patent was filed. All three men denied being Nakamoto when contacted by Penenberg.[66]\n\nIn May 2013, Ted Nelson speculated that Nakamoto was Japanese mathematician Shinichi Mochizuki.[68] Later, an article was published in The Age newspaper that claimed that Mochizuki denied these speculations, but without attributing a source for the denial.[69]\n\nA 2013 article in Vice listed Gavin Andresen, Jed McCaleb, or a government agency as possible candidates to be Nakamoto.[70]\n\nIn 2013, two Israeli mathematicians, Dorit Ron and Adi Shamir, published a paper claiming a link between Nakamoto and Ross Ulbricht. The two based their suspicion on an analysis of the network of bitcoin transactions,[71] but later retracted their claim.[72]\n\nIn 2016, the Financial Times said that Nakamoto might have been a group of people mentioning Hal Finney, Nick Szabo and Adam Back as potential members.[73] In 2020, the YouTube channel Barely Sociable claimed that Adam Back, inventor of bitcoin predecessor Hashcash, is Nakamoto.[74] Back subsequently denied this.[75]\n\nElon Musk denied he was Nakamoto in a tweet on 28 November 2017, responding to speculation the previous week in a medium.com post by a former SpaceX intern.[76]\n\nIn 2019 journalist Evan Ratliff claimed drug dealer Paul Le Roux could be Nakamoto.[77]",

          "context": "Proof of work\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\nJump to navigationJump to search\n\nThis article may require cleanup to meet Wikipedia's quality standards. The specific problem is: Needs verification and documentation. Please help improve this article if you can. (May 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)\nProof of work (PoW) is a form of cryptographic zero-knowledge proof in which one party (the prover) proves to others (the verifiers) that a certain amount of a specific computational effort has been expended. Verifiers can subsequently confirm this expenditure with minimal effort on their part. The concept was invented by Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor in 1993 as a way to deter denial-of-service attacks and other service abuses such as spam on a network by requiring some work from a service requester, usually meaning processing time by a computer. The term \"proof of work\" was first coined and formalized in a 1999 paper by Markus Jakobsson and Ari Juels.[1][2] Proof of work was later popularized by Bitcoin as a foundation for consensus in permissionless blockchains and cryptocurrencies, in which miners compete to append blocks and mint new currency, each miner experiencing a success probability proportional to their computational effort expended. PoW and PoS (proof of stake) are the two best known Sybil deterrence mechanisms. In the context of cryptocurrencies they are the most common mechanisms.[3]\n\nA key feature of proof-of-work schemes is their asymmetry: the work – the computation – must be moderately hard (yet feasible) on the prover or requester side but easy to check for the verifier or service provider. This idea is also known as a CPU cost function, client puzzle, computational puzzle, or CPU pricing function. Another common feature are built-in incentive-structures that reward allocating computational capacity to the network with value in the form of money.\n\nThe purpose of proof-of-work algorithms are not proving that certain work was carried out or that a computational puzzle was \"solved\", but deterring manipulation of data via the specific solution of establishing large energy and hardware-control requirements for the ability to do so.\n\n\nContents\n1\tBackground\n2\tVariants\n3\tList of proof-of-work functions\n4\tReusable proof-of-work\n5\tBitcoin-type proof of work\n5.1\tEnergy consumption\n5.2\tHistory modification\n5.3\tASICs and mining pools\n6\tSee also\n7\tNotes\n8\tReferences\n9\tExternal links\nBackground\nOne popular system, used in Hashcash, uses partial hash inversions to prove that computation was done, as a goodwill token to send an e-mail. For instance, the following header represents about 252 hash computations to send a message to calvin@comics.net on January 19, 2038:\n\nX-Hashcash: 1:52:380119:calvin@comics.net:::9B760005E92F0DAE\nIt is verified with a single computation by checking that the SHA-1 hash of the stamp (omit the header name X-Hashcash: including the colon and any amount of whitespace following it up to the digit '1') begins with 52 binary zeros, that is 13 hexadecimal zeros:[1]\n\n0000000000000756af69e2ffbdb930261873cd71\nWhether PoW systems can actually solve a particular denial-of-service issue such as the spam problem is subject to debate;[4][5] the system must make sending spam emails obtrusively unproductive for the spammer, but should also not prevent legitimate users from sending their messages. In other words, a genuine user should not encounter any difficulties when sending an email, but an email spammer would have to expend a considerable amount of computing power to send out many emails at once. Proof-of-work systems are being used by other, more complex cryptographic systems such as bitcoin, which uses a system similar to Hashcash.[4]\n\nVariants\nThere are two classes of proof-of-work protocols.\n\nChallenge–response protocols assume a direct interactive link between the requester (client) and the provider (server). The provider chooses a challenge, say an item in a set with a property, the requester finds the relevant response in the set, which is sent back and checked by the provider. As the challenge is chosen on the spot by the provider, its difficulty can be adapted to its current load. The work on the requester side may be bounded if the challenge-response protocol has a known solution (chosen by the provider), or is known to exist within a bounded search space.\nProof of Work challenge response.svg\nSolution–verification protocols do not assume such a link: as a result, the problem must be self-imposed before a solution is sought by the requester, and the provider must check both the problem choice and the found solution. Most such schemes are unbounded probabilistic iterative procedures such as Hashcash.\nProof of Work solution verification.svg\nKnown-solution protocols tend to have slightly lower variance than unbounded probabilistic protocols because the variance of a rectangular distribution is lower than the variance of a Poisson distribution (with the same mean).[further explanation needed] A generic technique for reducing variance is to use multiple independent sub-challenges, as the average of multiple samples will have a lower variance.\n\nThere are also fixed-cost functions such as the time-lock puzzle.\n\nMoreover, the underlying functions used by these schemes may be:\n\nCPU-bound where the computation runs at the speed of the processor, which greatly varies in time, as well as from high-end server to low-end portable devices.[6]\nMemory-bound[7][8][9][10] where the computation speed is bound by main memory accesses (either latency or bandwidth), the performance of which is expected to be less sensitive to hardware evolution.\nNetwork-bound[11] if the client must perform few computations, but must collect some tokens from remote servers before querying the final service provider. In this sense, the work is not actually performed by the requester, but it incurs delays anyway because of the latency to get the required tokens.\nFinally, some PoW systems offer shortcut computations that allow participants who know a secret, typically a private key, to generate cheap PoWs. The rationale is that mailing-list holders may generate stamps for every recipient without incurring a high cost. Whether such a feature is desirable depends on the usage scenario.\n\nList of proof-of-work functions\nHere is a list of known proof-of-work functions:\n\nInteger square root modulo a large prime[2][dubious – discuss]\nWeaken Fiat–Shamir signatures[2]\nOng–Schnorr–Shamir signature broken by Pollard[2]\nPartial hash inversion[12][13][1] This paper formalizes the idea of a proof of work and introduces \"the dependent idea of a bread pudding protocol\", a \"re-usable proof-of-work\" (RPoW) system.[14]\nHash sequences[15]\nPuzzles[16]\nDiffie-Hellman–based puzzle[17]\nModerate[7]\nMbound[8]\nHokkaido[9]\nCuckoo Cycle[10]\nMerkle tree–based[18]\nGuided tour puzzle protocol[11]\nReusable proof-of-work\nComputer scientist Hal Finney built on the proof-of-work idea, yielding a system that exploited reusable proof of work (RPoW).[19] The idea of making proofs of work reusable for some practical purpose had already been established in 1999.[1] Finney's purpose for RPoW was as token money. Just as a gold coin's value is thought to be underpinned by the value of the raw gold needed to make it, the value of an RPoW token is guaranteed by the value of the real-world resources required to 'mint' a PoW token. In Finney's version of RPoW, the PoW token is a piece of Hashcash.\n\nA website can demand a PoW token in exchange for service. Requiring a PoW token from users would inhibit frivolous or excessive use of the service, sparing the service's underlying resources, such as bandwidth to the Internet, computation, disk space, electricity, and administrative overhead.\n\nFinney's RPoW system differed from a PoW system in permitting the random exchange of tokens without repeating the work required to generate them. After someone had \"spent\" a PoW token at a website, the website's operator could exchange that \"spent\" PoW token for a new, unspent RPoW token, which could then be spent at some third-party website similarly equipped to accept RPoW tokens. This would save the resources otherwise needed to 'mint' a PoW token. The anti-counterfeit property of the RPoW token was guaranteed by remote attestation. The RPoW server that exchanges a used PoW or RPoW token for a new one of equal value uses remote attestation to allow any interested party to verify what software is running on the RPoW server. Since the source code for Finney's RPoW software was published (under a BSD-like license), any sufficiently knowledgeable programmer could, by inspecting the code, verify that the software (and, by extension, the RPoW server) never issued a new token except in exchange for a spent token of equal value.\n\nUntil 2009, Finney's system was the only RPoW system to have been implemented; it never saw economically significant use.\n\nRPoW is protected by the private keys stored in the trusted platform module (TPM) hardware and manufacturers holding TPM private keys. Stealing a TPM manufacturer's key or obtaining the key by examining the TPM chip itself would subvert that assurance.\n\nBitcoin-type proof of work\nIn 2009, the Bitcoin network went online. Bitcoin is a proof-of-work cryptocurrency that, like Finney's RPoW, is also based on the Hashcash PoW. But in Bitcoin, double-spend protection is provided by a decentralized P2P protocol for tracking transfers of coins, rather than the hardware trusted computing function used by RPoW. Bitcoin has better trustworthiness because it is protected by computation. Bitcoins are \"mined\" using the Hashcash proof-of-work function by individual miners and verified by the decentralized nodes in the P2P bitcoin network.\n\nThe difficulty is periodically adjusted to keep the block time around a target time.\n\nEnergy consumption\n\nBitcoin electricity consumption as of 2021[20]\nSince the creation of Bitcoin, proof-of-work has been the predominant design of peer-to-peer cryptocurrency. Studies have estimated the total energy consumption of cryptocurrency mining.[21] The PoW mechanism requires a vast amount of computing resources, which consume a significant amount of electricity. Bitcoin's total energy consumption is equivalent to that of a small country.[3] This energy consumption was found to cause large amounts of carbon emissions, interfering with contemporary inter-national climate change mitigation commitments. According to a 2021 study, mining for Bitcoin within China alone can be expected to soon exceed total annual emissions of European countries like Italy.[22][23]\n\nHistory modification\nEach block that is added to the blockchain, starting with the block containing a given transaction, is called a confirmation of that transaction. Ideally, merchants and services that receive payment in the cryptocurrency should wait for at least one confirmation to be distributed over the network, before assuming that the payment was done. The more confirmations that the merchant waits for, the more difficult it is for an attacker to successfully reverse the transaction in a blockchain—unless the attacker controls more than half the total network power, in which case it is called a 51% attack.[24]\n\nASICs and mining pools\nWithin the Bitcoin community there are groups working together in mining pools.[25] Some miners use application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) for PoW.[26] This trend toward mining pools and specialized ASICs has made mining some cryptocurrencies economically infeasible for most players without access to the latest ASICs, nearby sources of inexpensive energy, or other special advantages.[27]\n\nSome PoWs claim to be ASIC-resistant, i.e. to limit the efficiency gain that an ASIC can have over commodity hardware, like a GPU, to be well under an order of magnitude. ASIC resistance has the advantage of keeping mining economically feasible on commodity hardware, but also contributes to the corresponding risk that an attacker can briefly rent access to a large amount of unspecialized commodity processing power to launch a 51% attack against a cryptocurrency.[28]",

Unlike a proof of work (PoW) protocol, PoS systems do not incentivize extreme amounts of energy consumption. The first functioning use of PoS for cryptocurrency was Peercoin in 2012. The biggest proof-of-stake blockchain by \"market cap” is Cardano.\n\n\nContents\n1\tDescription\n2\tAttacks\n3\tVariants\n3.1\tVariations of stake definition\n3.2\tDelegated proof of stake\n4\tImplementations\n5\tReferences\nDescription\nFor a blockchain transaction to be recognized, it must be appended to the blockchain. Validators carry out this appending; in most protocols, they receive a reward for doing so.[1] For the blockchain to remain secure, it must have a mechanism to prevent a malicious user or group from taking over a majority of validation. PoS accomplishes this by requiring that validators have some quantity of blockchain tokens, requiring potential attackers to acquire a large fraction of the tokens on the blockchain to mount an attack.[2]\n\nProof of work, another commonly used consensus mechanism, uses a validation of computational prowess to verify transactions, requiring a potential attacker to acquire a large fraction of the computational power of the validator network.[2] This incentivizes consuming huge quantities of energy. PoS is tremendously more energy-efficient.[3]\n\nIn 2021, Elon Musk and Bill Gates were seen as damaging sentiment towards proof-of-work blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum by publicising their massive energy consumption. The efficiency of proof-of-stake coins such as Cardano, EOS, BitGreen and Stellar led to them being described as \"green coins\".[4][5][6][7]\n\nAttacks\nPoS protocols can suffer from the nothing-at-stake problem, where validator nodes validate conflicting copies of the blockchain because there is minimal cost to doing so, and a smaller chance of losing out on rewards by validating a block on the wrong chain. If this persists, it can allow double-spending.[8] This can be mitigated through penalizing validators who validate conflicting chains[8] or by structuring the rewards so that there is no economic incentive to create conflicts.[1]\n\nVariants\nVariations of stake definition\nThe exact definition of \"stake\" varies from implementation to implementation. For instance, some cryptocurrencies use the concept of \"coin age\", the product of the number of tokens with the amount of time that a single user has held them, rather than merely the number of tokens, to define a validator's stake.[2]\n\nDelegated proof of stake\nDelegated proof of stake (DPoS) systems separate the roles of the stake-holders and validators, by allowing stake-holders to delegate the validation role.[8]\n\nImplementations\nThe first functioning implementation of a proof-of-stake cryptocurrency was Peercoin, introduced in 2012.[1] Other cryptocurrencies, such as Blackcoin, Nxt, Cardano, and Algorand followed.[1] However, as of 2017, PoS cryptocurrencies were still not as widely used as proof-of-work cryptocurrencies.[9] The biggest proof-of-stake blockchains by “market cap” in 2021 were Cardano, Polkadot and Solana. Other prominent PoS platforms include Avalanche,[10] Tron, EOS, Algorand, and Tezos.[11][12][13]\n\nThere have been repeated proposals for Ethereum to switch from a PoW to PoS mechanism.[14][15] In April 2021, the Ethereum Foundation announced that it planned to switch to a PoS system by the end of 2021.[15] However, switching to a PoS system is a substantial change, and progress has not been steady. William Entriken, an Ethereum developer, said: \"You have to switch to proof of stake. Proof of work should be illegal.\" However, the change has \"always been three months away. These things don't just happen immediately.\"[14]",

Please help improve it by removing or replacing such wording. (May 2021) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)\nA non-fungible token (NFT) is a unit of data stored on a digital ledger, called a blockchain, that certifies a digital asset to be unique and therefore not interchangeable.[1] NFTs can be used to represent items such as photos, videos, audio, and other types of digital files. Access to any copy of the original file, however, is not restricted to the buyer of the NFT. While copies of these digital items are available for anyone to obtain, NFTs are tracked on blockchains to provide the owner with a proof of ownership that is separate from copyright.\n\nThe NFT market value tripled in 2020, reaching more than $250 million.[2] During the first quarter of 2021, NFT sales exceeded $2 billion.[3]\n\n\nContents\n1\tDescription\n2\tUses\n2.1\tDigital art\n2.2\tGenerative Art\n2.3\tCollectibles\n2.4\tAvatars (Profile Pictures)\n2.5\tGames\n2.6\tVirtual Worlds\n2.7\tMusic\n2.8\tFilm\n2.9\tMemes\n2.10\tSports\n2.11\tFashion\n2.12\tPornography\n2.13\tAcademia\n2.14\tUtilities\n3\tCopyright\n4\tStandards in blockchains\n4.1\tEthereum\n4.2\tFLOW\n4.3\tTezos\n5\tHistory\n5.1\tEarly history (2012–2017)\n5.2\tPublic awareness (2017–2021)\n5.3\tNFT buying surge (2021–present)\n6\tPopular culture\n6.1\tPopularity\n7\tCriticism\n7.1\tStorage off-chain\n7.2\tEnvironmental concerns\n7.3\tPlagiarism and fraud\n8\tSee also\n9\tReferences\n10\tExternal links\nDescription\nAn NFT is a unit of data stored on a digital ledger, called a blockchain, which can be sold and traded. The NFT can be associated with a particular digital or physical asset (such as a file or a physical object) and a license to use the asset for a specified purpose.[4] NFTs (and the associated license to use, copy or display the underlying asset) can be traded and sold on digital markets.[5]\n\nNFTs function like cryptographic tokens, but, unlike cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, NFTs are not mutually interchangeable, so not fungible. While all bitcoins are equal, each NFT may represent a different underlying asset and thus have a different value.[6] NFTs are created when blockchains string records of cryptographic hash, a set of characters identifying a set of data, onto previous records therefore creating a chain of identifiable data blocks.[7] This cryptographic transaction process ensures the authentication of each digital file by providing a digital signature that is used to track NFT ownership.[7] However, data links that point to details like where the art is stored can die.[8]\n\nUses\n\nThis image, Hashmask 15753 (1 of 16,384) by \"Suum Cuique Labs GmbH\", sold with an NFT on the Ethereum blockchain.\nThe unique identity and ownership of an NFT is verifiable via the blockchain ledger.[9] Ownership of the NFT is often associated with a license to use the underlying digital asset, but generally does not confer copyright to the buyer: some agreements only grant a license for personal, non-commercial use, while other licenses also allow commercial use of the underlying digital asset.[10]\n\nDigital art\nDigital art was an early use case for NFTs, because of the ability of blockchain technology to assure the unique signature and ownership of NFTs.[11] The digital artwork entitled \"Everydays – The First 5000 Days\", by artist Mike Winkelmann, also known as Beeple, sold for US$69.3 million in 2021.[5][12] The purchase resulted in the third-highest auction price achieved for a living artist, after Jeff Koons and David Hockney. Another Beeple piece entitled \"Crossroad\", consisting of a 10-second video showing animated pedestrians walking past a figure of Donald J. Trump, sold for US$6.6 million at Nifty Gateway, an online cryptocurrency marketplace for digital art.[13][14]\n\nA 3D-rendered model of a home named \"Mars House\", created by artist Krista Kim, was sold as a piece of digital real estate on the NFT market for over US$500,000.[15]\n\nGenerative Art\nDistinct from Digital Art, a new form called Generative Art incorporates algorithms developed by the artist that generate on-demand unique pieces when the token is minted. [16]Generative art is being experimented by projects such as Art Blocks, where Sotheby's sold 19 pieces totaling $81,000.[17]\n\nCollectibles\nNFTs can represent digital collectibles like physical card collections, however in a completely digital format. In February 2021, a LeBron James slam dunk NFT card on the NBA Top Shot platform sold for $208,000.[18]\n\nAvatars (Profile Pictures)\nNFTs are commonly used as avatars / profile pictures (PFPs) for social media and online identity. This trend originates from the 2017 project CryptoPunks which allowed the mint of 10,000 unique NFT characters. Brand[19] and celebrity acquisitions of rare NFTs has resulted in a surge of 10,000 piece NFT collections dedicated to generative avatars.\n\nGames\nNFTs can also be used to represent in-game assets, such as digital plots of land, which are controlled by the user instead of the game developer. NFTs allow assets to be traded on third-party marketplaces without permission from the game developer. In February 2021, Axie Infinity recorded a sale of $1.5 million for digital land titles in a single sale.[20]\n\nVirtual Worlds\nDescribed as the Metaverse, virtual worlds such as Decentraland, Sandbox, CryptoVoxels and Somnium Space allow users to create galleries to show off NFT art, clothes, real estate and attend live events with friends online. They use NFTs to auction off limited objects such as virtual land. The open standards means users can seamlessly transact and bring external NFT objects onto their purchased land. In June 2021, a plot of virtual land sized 16 acres on Decentraland was sold for $913,228.20.[21]\n\nMusic\nBlockchain and the technology enabling the network have given the opportunity for musicians to tokenize and publish their work as non-fungible tokens. This has extended the list of options for musicians and artists alike to monetize and profit from their music as well as other content surrounding the themes of the music and the artists public image. Additionally, NFTs have provided the opportunity for artists and touring musicians to recuperate lost income due to the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic which resulted in music industry revenues falling nearly 85%.[22]\n\nNFTs were utilized by artists to increase revenue during the COVID-19 pandemic. In February 2021, NFTs reportedly generated around $25 million within the music industry (in an industry with annual revenue of over $20 billion).[23] On February 28, 2021, electronic dance musician 3LAU sold a collection of 33 NFTs for a total of $11.7 million to commemorate the three-year anniversary of his Ultraviolet album.[24] On March 3, 2021, rock band Kings of Leon became the first to announce the release of a new album, When You See Yourself, in the form of an NFT which generated a reported $2 million in sales.[25] Other musicians that have used NFTs include American rapper Lil Pump,[26][27][28] artist Shepard Fairey[29][30] and rapper Eminem.[31]\n\nFilm\nIn May 2018, 20th Century Fox partnered with Atom Tickets and released limited-edition Deadpool 2 digital posters to promote the film. They were available from Opensea.io and the GFT exchange.[32][33] In March 2021,[34] Adam Benzine's Oscar-nominated documentary Claude Lanzmann: Spectres of the Shoah became the first motion picture, documentary and Academy Award-nominated film to be minted and auctioned as an NFT,[35][36] via the Rarible platform.[34]\n\nOther projects in the film industry using NFTs include the announcement that an exclusive NFT artwork collection will be released for Godzilla vs. Kong[37] and director Kevin Smith announcing in April 2021 that his forthcoming horror movie Killroy Was Here would be released as an NFT.[38]\n\nMemes\nA number of internet memes have been associated with NFTs, which were minted and sold by their creators or by their subjects.[39] Examples include Doge, an image of a Shiba Inu dog whose NFT was sold for $4 million in June 2021,[40] as well as Charlie Bit My Finger,[41] Nyan Cat[42] and Disaster Girl.[43]\n\nSports\nNFTs have also been used in sports, in September 2019, NBA player Spencer Dinwiddie tokenized his contract so that others can invest into it.[44][45] In addition, Dapper Labs, a blockchain technology-based company, has collaborated with the NBA to create \"N.B.A Top Shot\", a marketplace for digital highlight clips.[13]\n\nFashion\nIn 2019, Nike acquired a patent that allows for blockchain technology to attach cryptographically secured digital assets in the form of NFTs to physical products, such as a pair of sneakers, under the name \"CryptoKicks\".[46][47]\n\nPornography\nSome porn stars have also tokenized their pornographic work, allowing for the sale of unique content for their customers, though hostility from NFT marketplaces towards pornographic material has presented significant drawbacks for creators.[48][49]\n\nAcademia\nIn May 2021, UC Berkeley announced that it would be auctioning NFTs for the patent disclosures for two Nobel Prize-winning inventions: CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing and cancer immunotherapy.[50] The university will continue to own the patents for these inventions, as the NFTs relate only to the university patent disclosure form, an internal form used by the university for researchers to disclose inventions.[50] The NFTs were sold on June 8, 2021 for 22 ETH (ca. $55,000).[51]\n\nUtilities\nBeyond the tokenization of a digital asset, new utilities on non-fungible tokens are emerging.\n\nIn fields such as notarization and attestation, the Singapore Government will issue digital certificates for graduates [52] using OpenCert that number 10,000 certificates a year to automate the 2,000 verification requests per year from employers and other schools.[53] The Singapore Ministry of Health will also issue digital Vaccination Certificates for travel using OpenCert. [54]\n\nNFT collection VeeFriends launched by Gary Vaynerchuk gives each token holder exclusive access to an in-person marketing and entrepreneurship conference called \"VeeCon\" in 2022, 2023 and 2024. [55]\n\nRules of access that grant rights to redeem intangible value is a rapidly growing utility. Community NFTs such as \"Bored Ape Yacht Club\" and \"Pudgy Penguins\" entitles token holders to benefits, including membership entry to a private Discord server by validating the NFT exists in the wallet against entry. [56][57]\n\nCopyright\nOwnership of an NFT does not inherently grant copyright to whatever digital asset the token represents.[58][59] While someone may sell an NFT representing their work, the buyer will not necessarily receive copyright privileges when ownership of the NFT is changed and so the original owner is allowed to create more NFTs of the same work.[60][61] In that sense, an NFT is merely a proof of ownership that is separate from a copyright.[59][62] According to legal scholar Rebecca Tushnet, \"In one sense, the purchaser acquires whatever the art world thinks they have acquired. They definitely do not own the copyright to the underlying work unless it is explicitly transferred.\"[63] In practice, NFT purchasers do not generally acquire the copyright of the underlying artwork.[64]\n\nStandards in blockchains\nSpecific token standards have been created to support various blockchain use-cases. These include the Ethereum ERC-721 standard of CryptoKitties, and the more recent ERC-1155 standard.[65] The FLOW and Bitcoin Cash blockchains support NFTs.[66][67]\n\nEthereum\nERC-721[65] was the first standard for representing non-fungible digital assets on the Ethereum blockchain. ERC-721 is an inheritable Solidity smart contract standard, meaning that developers can create new ERC-721-compliant contracts by importing it from the OpenZeppelin library. ERC-721 provides core methods that allow tracking the owner of a unique identifier, as well as a permissioned way for the owner to transfer the asset to others.[68]\n\nThe ERC-1155 standard[65] offers \"semi-fungibility\", as well as providing a superset of ERC-721 functionality (meaning that an ERC-721 asset could be built using ERC-1155). Unlike ERC-721 where a unique ID represents a single asset, the unique ID of an ERC-1155 token represent a class of assets, and there is an additional quantity field to represent the amount of the class that a particular wallet has.[69] The assets under the same class are interchangeable, and the user can transfer any amount of assets to others.[69]\n\nFLOW\nThe FLOW blockchain which uses proof of stake consensus model supports NFTs, for example NBA Top Shot is run on the FLOW blockchain. Cryptokitties plans to switch from Ethereum to FLOW in the future.[66]\n\nTezos\nTezos is a blockchain network that operates on proof of stake and supports the sale of NFT art.[70]\n\nHistory\nEarly history (2012–2017)\n\nPresentation of Etheria at DEVCON 1. November 13, 2015.\nThe first one-off NFT was created on May 3, 2014, by Kevin McCoy and Anil Dash, live at the Seven on Seven conference at the New Museum in New York City. This experiment represents the first time a non-fungible, tradable blockchain marker was explicitly, via on-chain metadata (enabled by Namecoin), linked to a unique work of art,[71] standing in stark contrast to the multi-unit, fungible, metadata-less \"colored coins\" of other blockchains and Counterparty.\n\nIn October, 2015, the first fully-fledged NFT project, Etheria, was launched and demonstrated live at DEVCON 1, Ethereum's first developer conference, in London, UK, just three months after the launch of the Ethereum blockchain itself. Most of Etheria's 457 purchasable and tradable hexagonal tiles went unsold for more than 5 years until March 13, 2021, when renewed interest in NFTs sparked a buying frenzy. Within 24 hours, all tiles of the current version and a prior version, each hardcoded to 1 ETH ($0.43 cents at the time of launch), were sold for a total of $1.4 million.[72]\n\nPublic awareness (2017–2021)\nIn 2017, the Ethereum blockchain started to gain prominence over bitcoin based token platforms, due to Ethereum having a system for token creation and storage built right into its blockchain thus eliminating the need for third-party platforms like Counterparty, and was the company to coin the term non-fungible token. Also in 2017, the American studio Larva Labs released CryptoPunks, a project to trade unique cartoon characters, on the Ethereum blockchain.[73][74][75] In late 2017, another project called CryptoKitties where players adopt and trade virtual cats was released and quickly went viral, raising a $12.5 million investment and some kitties were selling for over $100,000.[76][77][78]\n\nIn 2018, Decentraland, a blockchain-based virtual world, raised $26 million in an initial coin offering, and had a $20 million internal economy as of September 2018.[79][80]\n\nIn 2019, Nike patented a system called CryptoKicks that would use NFTs to verify the authenticity of physical sneakers and give a virtual version of the shoe to the customer.[81]\n\nIn early 2020, the developer of CryptoKitties, Dapper Labs, released the beta version of NBA TopShot, a project to sell tokenized collectibles of NBA highlights.[82] The project was built on top of Flow, a newer and more efficient blockchain compared to Ethereum.[66] Later that year, the project was released to the public and reported over $230 million in gross sales as of February 28, 2021.[83]\n\nThe NFT market experienced rapid growth during 2020, with its value tripling to $250 million.[84] In the first three months of 2021, more than $200 million were spent on NFTs.[85]\n\nNFT buying surge (2021–present)\nIn 2021, interest in NFTs increased. Blockchains such as Ethereum, Flow, and Tezos established specific standards to ensure that the digital item represented are authentically one-of-a-kind. NFTs are now being used to commodify digital assets in art, music, sports, and other popular entertainment, with most NFTs part of the Ethereum blockchain, while other blockchains can implement their own versions of NFTs.[86] A number of high-profile sales were made just in the first few months of the year.[87] In February 2021, the musician Grimes sold around $6 million worth of tokens representing digital art on Nifty Gateway.[88] Later that month, an NFT representing the meme animation Nyan Cat was sold in an Internet marketplace for just under $600,000.[89] On February 28, 2021, electronic dance musician 3LAU sold a collection of 33 NFTs for a total of $11.7 million to commemorate the three-year anniversary of his Ultraviolet album.[24] On March 5, 2021, the band Kings of Leon became the first to sell a newly released album, When You See Yourself, in the form of an NFT, generating a reported $2 million in sales.[90][91] On March 11, 2021, American digital artist Beeple's work Everydays: The First 5000 Days became the first NFT artwork to be listed at prominent auction house Christie's and sold for $69.3 million.[92][93] On March 22, 2021, Jack Dorsey, founder of Twitter and Square, sold an NFT representing his first tweet for over $2.5 million.[61][94]\n\nThe speculative market for NFTs has led more investors to trade at greater volumes and rates.[93] The buying surge of NFTs was called an economic bubble by experts, who also compared it to the Dot-com bubble.[95][96] By mid-April 2021, demand appeared to have substantially subsided, causing prices to fall significantly; early buyers were reported to have \"done supremely well\" by Bloomberg Businessweek.[97][98] An NFT of the source code of the World Wide Web, credited to internet inventor computer scientist Sir Tim Berners-Lee, was auctioned in June 2021 by Sotheby’s in London,[99][100][101] and was sold for USD$5.4 million.[102]\n\nPopular culture\nPopularity\nIn 2017, NFTs circulated by CryptoKitties, a project developed by Dapper Labs to sell ownership of unique cat avatars, jumped so much in popularity that a surge in demand took up significant transaction space on the Ethereum blockchain and slowed the entire Ethereum network in December of that year.[103][104]\n\nNFTs became increasingly popular in the early months of 2021 because of numerous high-profile sales,[87] including an NBA Top Shot video clip of LeBron James for $208,000, a 3LAU album for $11.7 million, and a piece by digital artist Beeple for $69.3 million.[87][105][106] NFT sales exceeded $220 million in March 2021 alone, making up nearly half of all-time NFT sales up to that point.[107] This renewed interest in NFTs, particularly those in art, music, and sports, made way into public consciousness, especially amongst the younger generation.[108][109] A comedy skit on the March 27, 2021 episode of Saturday Night Live satirized the popularity of NFTs; the skit was sold as an NFT itself for $365,000 on April 6, 2021.[110]\n\nIn 2021, many investors have been willing to pay high rates to secure and promote NFTs, anticipating them to be the biggest and most profitable collectibles in the future.[111][112] In April 2021, venture capitalist David Pakman claimed that the growing value of NFTs was redefining the major entertainment industry.[113] Investors like Mark Cuban have proposed new ways of implementing NFT technology to monetize sports tickets and merchandise sales.[114]\n\nCriticism\nStorage off-chain\nNFTs involving digital art generally do not store the file on the blockchain due to its size. The token functions in a way more similar to a certificate of ownership, with a web address pointing to the piece of art in question, making the art still subject to link rot.[71]\n\nEnvironmental concerns\nNFT purchases and sales are enmeshed in a controversy regarding the high energy use, and consequent greenhouse gas emissions, associated with blockchain transactions.[115] A major aspect of this is the proof-of-work protocol required to regulate and verify blockchain transactions on public networks, which consumes a large amount of electricity.[116][117] Estimating the carbon footprint of a given NFT transaction involves a variety of assumptions about the manner in which that transaction is set up on the blockchain, the economic behavior of blockchain miners (and the energy demands of their mining equipment),[118] as well as the amount of renewable energy being used on these networks.[119] There are also conceptual questions, such as whether the carbon footprint estimate for an NFT purchase should incorporate some portion of the ongoing energy demand of the underlying network, or just the marginal impact of that particular purchase.[120] An analogy that's been described for this is the footprint associated with an additional passenger on a given airline flight.[115]\n\nSome more recent NFT technologies use alternative validation protocols, such as proof of stake, that have much less energy usage for a given validation cycle. Other approaches to reducing electricity include the use of off-chain transactions as part of minting an NFT.[115] A number of NFT art sites are also looking to address these concerns, and some are moving to using technologies and protocols with lower associated footprints.[121] Others now allow the option of buying carbon offsets when making NFT purchases, although the environmental benefits of this have been questioned.[122] In some instances, NFT artists have decided against selling some of their own work to limit carbon emission contributions.[123]\n\nPlagiarism and fraud\nThere have been examples of \"artists having their work copied without permission\" and sold as an NFT.[124] After the artist Qing Han died in 2020, her identity was assumed by a fraudster and a number of her works became available for purchase as NFTs.[125] A process known as \"sleepminting\" can also allow a fraudster to mint an NFT in an artist's wallet and transfer it back to their own account without the artist becoming aware.[126] This allowed a white hat hacker to mint a fraudulent NFT that had seemingly originated from the wallet of the artist Beeple.[126]",

          "context": "Binance Coin Price & Market Data\nBinance Coin price today is $483.35 with a 24-hour trading volume of $3,321,662,720. BNB price is up 1.8% in the last 24 hours. It has a circulating supply of 150 Million BNB coins and a total supply of 171 Million. If you are looking to buy or sell Binance Coin, Binance is currently the most active exchange.\n\n \n\nWhat is Binance Coin (BNB)?\n\n\nBinance Coin (BNB) is an exchange-based token created and issued by the cryptocurrency exchange Binance. Initially created on the Ethereum blockchain as an ERC-20 token in July 2017, BNB was migrated over to Binance Chain in February 2019 and became the native coin of the Binance Chain.\n\nBinance Coin has seen massive growth in interest throughout the years. Several rounds of token burn events have appreciated BNB price and pushed it up as one of the top-10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. BNB can be traded in over 300 trading pairs across 120 exchanges tracked. \n\nWhat is Binance?\nBinance is the cryptocurrency exchange founded by Changpeng Zhao and He Yi in July 2017. Binance started with an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) and has since grown into one of the largest global cryptocurrency exchanges, both in terms of volume traded and market share by web traffic.\n\n\n\nThe Binance exchange is separated into the Spot market, Futures market, as well as the decentralized exchange, Binance DEX.\n\nWhat can you use BNB for?\nBNB was initially created as part of the Binance exchange through its ICO. In its whitepaper, Binance states that BNB was designed to be used to pay discounted fees on the Binance platform and also function as the native token powering the Binance Chain.\n\nIn addition to the initial use cases, BNB has added other cases both on and outside of the Binance platforms. Here’s an overview of BNB use cases:\n\nReduced Trading Fees - When trading fees on Binance are paid using BNB, users are entitled to a 25% discount in fees.\n\nBinance Account Tier - Users with account balances in BNB and 30 days accumulated trading volume above certain thresholds are given VIP tiers with additional fee discounts and perks.\n\nDust Conversion - Users can convert non-tradeable amounts of various cryptocurrencies called dust in their Binance account into BNB. \n\nIEO Lottery - Binance’s Initial Exchange Offerings (IEO) are conducted using lottery allocations determined using the amount of BNB held by users. \n\nBinance Chain Native Token - Much like how Ether (ETH) is used to pay for fees on the Ethereum Blockchain, BNB is used to pay for fees on the Binance Chain. BNB is needed to trade on the Binance DEX.\n\nSpent as Cryptocurrency - In addition to being used on Binance’s platforms, BNB can also be spent for payments in various ways, such as paying for travels, credit card fees, gifts and more. The full list is available here.\n\nThere may be more ways to use BNB that have not been covered here, but generally BNB can be used like any other cryptocurrencies to pay for goods and services as long as the merchant accepts it.\n\nBinance Coin (BNB) Burn\nBinance Coin (BNB) is designed with token burn in mind to induce scarcity and drive up the value of the token. In its v1.1 whitepaper (archived copy), Binance stated that 20% of Binance’s profits will be used to purchase BNB and subsequently destroyed in every quarter. In 2019, Binance updated its whitepaper to v1.2. In the updated whitepaper, it is stated that BNB burns will now be based on its exchanges’ trading volume.\n\nSince Binance began burning BNB in Oct 2017, 10 rounds of token burns have taken place, with about 16.7 million BNB worth approximately $208 million burned up till January 2020.\n\nHolding and Storing Binance Coin (BNB)\nBinance Coin (BNB) is supported by various hardware and software wallet providers. The choice between hardware and software wallets is mostly a balancing act between convenience and security to the user. We’ll provide a quick rundown on them in this section.\n\nGenerally, hardware wallets (e.g. Ledger) are non-custodial wallets which keep private keys of a wallet offline and only the owner knows it. This is arguably the safest option for storage as the user has full ownership of the coins, but is likely the least convenient as it requires the user to operate additional hardware to spend/use the cryptocurrency. \n\nNon-custodial software wallets (e.g. Trust Wallet, Atomic Wallet) is the next option in terms of safety compared to hardware wallets, although they are likely more convenient. The private keys are also owned by the user, but since the wallet is kept on an online device (eg. the phone), there is a higher risk of losing the funds as hackers can access devices which are connected to the internet.\n\nLastly, arguably the most convenient yet risky storage method would be storing funds on custodial wallets (eg. on a centralized exchange such as Binance) as users do not own the private keys to the funds. A hack on the storage location can potentially cause users to lose their funds, much like what happened during the infamous 2014 Mt. Gox hack which recorded a massive loss of 850,000 BTC, most of which are customer funds.\n\nCheck out the full list of wallets which supports BNB on Binance’s own updated list here.\n\nAre there any Binance Coin (BNB) Derivatives?\nYes, if you are looking to enter a long or short BNB position, both perpetual swaps and futures are available for BNB. Perpetual swap trading pairs are available across several platforms, including on Binance’s very own derivative exchange, Binance Futures with the BNBUSDT perpetual swap pair. For those who are looking for BNB futures trading, only FTX offers it at the moment.\n\nCheck out the full list of derivative products or derivative exchanges listed on CoinGecko.\n\nWhere can I learn more about Binance Coin (BNB)?\nTo learn more about Binance Coin, you may watch an AltcoinBuzz's interview with CZ, CEO of Binance Exchange, here",

          "context": "Cryptocurrency wallet\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\nJump to navigationJump to search\n\nAn example paper printable bitcoin wallet consisting of one bitcoin address for receiving and the corresponding private key for spending.\nA cryptocurrency wallet is a device,[1] physical medium,[2] program or a service which stores the public and/or private keys[3] for cryptocurrency transactions. In addition to this basic function of storing the keys, a cryptocurrency wallet more often also offers the functionality of encrypting and/or signing information. Signing can for example result in executing a smart contract, a cryptocurrency transaction (see \"bitcoin transaction\" image), identification or legally signing a 'document' (see \"application form\" image).[4]\n\n\nContents\n1\tTechnology\n1.1\tPrivate and public key generation\n1.2\tDuplicate private key\n1.3\tSeed phrases\n1.4\tWallets\n1.5\tCrypto Wallets vs Dapp Browsers\n2\tCharacteristics\n2.1\tSimple cryptocurrency wallet\n2.2\teID wallet\n2.3\tMultisignature wallet\n2.4\tSmart contract\n2.5\tKey derivation\n2.5.1\tDeterministic wallet\n2.5.2\tNon-deterministic wallet\n3\tConcerns\n3.1\tWallet access permissions\n3.2\tVulnerabilities\n4\tSee also\n5\tReferences\nTechnology\nPrivate and public key generation\nA crypto currency wallet works by a theoretical or random number being generated and used with a length depending on the algorithm size of the cryptocurrency's technology requirements. The number is then converted to a private key using the specific requirements of the cryptocurrency cryptography algorithm requirement. A public key is then generated from the private key using whichever cryptographic algorithm requirements are required. The private key is utilised by the owner to access and send cryptocurrency and is private to the owner, whereas the public key is to be shared to any third party to receive cryptocurrency.\n\nUp to this stage no computer or electronic device is required and all (key pair) can be mathematically derived and written down by hand. The private key and public key pair (known as address) are not known by the blockchain or anyone else. The blockchain will only record the transaction of the public address when cryptocurrency is sent to it, thus recording in the blockchain ledger the transaction of the public address.\n\nDuplicate private key\nCollision prevention of having 2 or more wallets with the same private key is a possibility (as key's can be generated without transactions sent to them thus being offline until recorded in the blockchain ledger) negated by the theoretical possibility of such a combination of 2 or more private key's being similar is theoretically difficult to achieve due to the amount of possible wallets in a certain cryptocurrency cryptography being equated to briefly less than atoms in the universe, a high enough number to be incomprehensible to duplicate and difficult to hack.[5] [6]\n\nSeed phrases\nIn modern convention a seed phrase is now utilised which is a 12 to 24 word and greater word phrase that is an unencrypted form of the private key in dictionary word format which is simpler to remember then a encrypted cryptographic key in another string format. When online, exchange and hardware wallets are generated using random numbers a seed phrase is asked to be recorded by the user, so that when access to the wallet becomes misplaced, damaged or compromised, the seed phrase can be used to re-access the wallet and associated keys and cryptocurrency.[7]\n\nWallets\nA number of technologies known as wallets exist that store the key value pair of private and public key known as wallets. A wallet hosts the details of the key pair making transacting cryptocurrency possible. There exists multiple methods of storing keys or seed in a wallet from using paper wallets which are traditional public, private or seed keys written on paper to using hardware wallets which are dedicated hardware to securely store your wallet information, using an digital wallet which is a computer with a software hosting your wallet information, hosting your wallet using an exchange where cryptocurrency is traded. or by storing your wallet information on a digital medium such as plaintext.[8]\n\nCrypto Wallets vs Dapp Browsers\nDapp browsers are specialized software that sustains new generation decentralized applications. Dapp browsers are considered to be the browsers of Web 3.0 and are the gateway to access the decentralized applications which are working based on blockchain technology. That means all Dapp Browsers must have a unique code system to unify all the different codes of the dapps.\n\nWhile crypto wallets are focused on the exchange, purchase, sale of digital assets[9] and support narrowly targeted applications, the browsers support different kinds of applications of various formats, including exchange, games, NFTs marketplaces, etc[10].\n\nTechnical specifications of different browsers may or may not include features such as:\n\n    Full support for all modern Web2.0 technologies;\n    Built-in Ethereum mainnet/testnet RPC, fully compatible with Web3.0;\n    Built-in Ethereum wallet (using smart contracts);\n    Dapp naming support\nCharacteristics\nIn addition to the basic function of storing the keys, a cryptocurrency wallet may also have one or more of the following characteristics.\n\nSimple cryptocurrency wallet\n\nAn actual bitcoin transaction from a web based cryptocurrency exchange to a hardware cryptocurrency wallet.\nA simple cryptocurrency wallet contains pairs of public and private cryptographic keys. The keys can be used to track ownership, receive or spend cryptocurrencies.[11] A public key allows others to make payments to the address derived from it, whereas a private key enables the spending of cryptocurrency from that address.[12]\n\nThe cryptocurrency itself is not in the wallet. In the case of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies derived from it, the cryptocurrency is decentrally stored and maintained in a publicly available distributed ledger called the blockchain.[11]\n\neID wallet\n\nProviding an eID and a diploma and digitally signing the 'application form' with a crypto wallet app.\nSome wallets are specifically designed to be compatible with a framework. The European Union is creating an eIDAS compatible European Self-Sovereign Identity Framework (ESSIF) which runs on the European Blockchain Services Infrastructure (EBSI). The EBSI wallet is designed to (securely) provide information, an eID and to sign 'transactions'.[4]\n\nMultisignature wallet\nMain article: Multisignature\nIn contrast to simple cryptocurrency wallets requiring just one party to sign a transaction, multisignature wallets require multiple parties to sign a transaction.[13] Multisignature wallets are designed to have increased security.[14]\n\nSmart contract\nIn the cryptocurrency space, smart contracts are digitally signed in the same way a cryptocurrency transaction is signed. The signing keys are held in a cryptocurrency wallet.\n\nKey derivation\nDeterministic wallet\n\nA deterministic wallet seed phrase of a crypto wallet.\nWith a deterministic wallet a single key can be used to generate an entire tree of key pairs.[15] This single key serves as the root of the tree. The generated mnemonic sentence or word seed is simply a more human-readable way of expressing the key used as the root, as it can be algorithmically converted into the root private key. Those words, in that order, will always generate exactly the same root key. A word phrase could consist of 24 words like: begin friend black earth beauty praise pride refuse horror believe relief gospel end destroy champion build better awesome. That single root key is not replacing all other private keys, but rather is being used to generate them. All the addresses still have different private keys, but they can all be restored by that single root key. The private keys to every address it has and will ever give out in the future can be recalculated given the root key. That root key, in turn, can be recalculated by feeding in the word seed. The mnemonic sentence is the backup of the wallet. If a wallet supports the same (mnemonic sentence) technique, then the backup can also be restored on another software or hardware wallet.\n\nA mnemonic sentence is considered secure. The BIP-39 standard creates a 512-bit seed from any given mnemonic. The set of possible wallets is 2512. Every passphrase leads to a valid wallet. If the wallet was not previously used it will be empty.[11]:104\n\nNon-deterministic wallet\nIn a non-deterministic wallet, each key is randomly generated on its own accord, and they are not seeded from a common key. Therefore, any backups of the wallet must store each and every single private key used as an address, as well as a buffer of 100 or so future keys that may have already been given out as addresses but not received payments yet.[11]:94\n\nConcerns\nWallet access permissions\nWhen choosing a wallet, the owner must keep in mind who is supposed to have access to (a copy of) the private keys and thus potentially has signing capabilities. In case of cryptocurrency the user needs to trust the provider to keep the cryptocurrency safe, just like with a bank. Trust was misplaced in the case of the Mt. Gox exchange, which 'lost' most of their clients' bitcoins. Downloading a cryptocurrency wallet from a wallet provider to a computer or phone does not automatically mean that the owner is the only one who has a copy of the private keys. For example, with Coinbase, it is possible to install a wallet on a phone and to also have access to the same wallet through their website.\n\nVulnerabilities\nA wallet can also have known or unknown vulnerabilities. A supply chain attack or side-channel attack are ways of a vulnerability introduction. In extreme cases even a computer which is not connected to any network can be hacked.[16]\n\nWhen using a software wallet for receiving cryptocurrency, access to the receiving wallet is not needed—the sending party only need know the destination address, thus anyone can send cryptocurrency to an address. Only the one who has the private key of the corresponding (public key) address otherwise has access.",
