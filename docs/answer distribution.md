| 11       | 1            | As blocks each contain information about the block previous to it, they form a chain, with each additional block reinforcing the ones before it. Therefore, blockchains are resistant to modification of their data because once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks. Blockchains are typically managed by a peer-to-peer network for use as a publicly distributed ledger, where nodes collectively adhere to a protocol to communicate and validate new blocks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

Ethereum expands these concepts by harnessing that same block chain capability for computer code. While Bitcoin offers one particular application of block chain technology, a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, Ethereum allows for scripts of code to be run as a global computational network. This concept has a wide range of potential applications such as voting, global supply chains, medical records, the financial system -- the opportunities are endless.

| 50       | 1            | A smart contract is a computer program or a transaction protocol which is intended to automatically execute, control or document legally relevant events and actions according to the terms of a contract or an agreement. \[1\]\[2\]\[3\]\[4\] The objectives of smart contracts are the reduction of need in trusted intermediators, arbitrations and enforcement costs, fraud losses, as well as the reduction of malicious and accidental exceptions. \[5\]\[2\]

Vending machines are mentioned as the oldest piece of technology equivalent to smart contract implementation. \[3\] 2014's white paper about the cryptocurrency Ethereum\[6\] describes the Bitcoin protocol as a weak version of the smart contract concept as defined by computer scientist, lawyer and cryptographer Nick Szabo. Since Ethereum, various cryptocurrencies support scripting languages which allow for more advanced smart contracts between untrusted parties.                                                                               |

| 54       | 1            | An ERC20 token is a blockchain-based asset with similar functionality to bitcoin, ether, and bitcoin cash: it can hold value and be sent and received. The major difference between ERC20 tokens and other cryptocurrencies is that ERC20 tokens are created and hosted on the Ethereum blockchain, whereas bitcoin and bitcoin cash are the native currencies of their respective blockchains. ERC20 tokens are stored and sent using ethereum addresses and transactions, and use gas to cover transaction fees.

| 68       | 1            | Cryptocurrency transactions are normally irreversible after a number of blocks confirm the transaction. Additionally, cryptocurrency private keys can be permanently lost from local storage due to malware, data loss or the destruction of the physical media. This precludes the cryptocurrency from being spent, resulting in its effective removal from the markets. \[154\]

Users send and receive bitcoins, the units of currency, by broadcasting digitally signed messages to the network using bitcoin cryptocurrency wallet software. Transactions are recorded into a distributed, replicated public database known as the blockchain, with consensus achieved by a proof-of-work system called mining.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

More simply, it is a platform for sharing information across the globe that cannot be manipulated or changed. How is it different than bitcoin? Bitcoin was a pioneer in the blockchain revolution by establishing a public, permissionless, distributed ledger system to validate, store, and replicate transaction data on computers all over the world. Ethereum expands these concepts by harnessing that same block chain capability for computer code. While Bitcoin offers one particular application of block chain technology, a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, Ethereum allows for scripts of code to be run as a global computational network. This concept has a wide range of potential applications such as voting, global supply chains, medical records, the financial system -- the opportunities are endless.

| 7        | 1            | The proof-of-stake is a method of securing a cryptocurrency network and achieving distributed consensus through requesting users to show ownership of a certain amount of currency. It is different from proof-of-work systems that run difficult hashing algorithms to validate electronic transactions. The scheme is largely dependent on the coin, and there's currently no standard form of it. Some cryptocurrencies use a combined proof-of-work and proof-of-stake scheme.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| 19       | 1            | Ethereum is a distributed public blockchain network that focuses on running the programming code of any decentralized application. More simply, it is a platform for sharing information across the globe that cannot be manipulated or changed. How is it different than bitcoin? Bitcoin was a pioneer in the blockchain revolution by establishing a public, permissionless, distributed ledger system to validate, store, and replicate transaction data on computers all over the world. Ethereum expands these concepts by harnessing that same block chain capability for computer code. While Bitcoin offers one particular application of block chain technology, a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, Ethereum allows for scripts of code to be run as a global computational network. This concept has a wide range of potential applications such as voting, global supply chains, medical records, the financial system -- the opportunities are endless.                                                                            |

| 36       | 1            | Bitcoin was a pioneer in the blockchain revolution by establishing a public, permissionless, distributed ledger system to validate, store, and replicate transaction data on computers all over the world. Ethereum expands these concepts by harnessing that same block chain capability for computer code. While Bitcoin offers one particular application of block chain technology, a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, Ethereum allows for scripts of code to be run as a global computational network.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| 47       | 1            | Cryptocurrencies use various timestamping schemes to "prove" the validity of transactions added to the blockchain ledger without the need for a trusted third party. The first timestamping scheme invented was the proof-of-work scheme. The most widely used proof-of-work schemes are based on SHA-256 and scrypt. \[16\]

| 52       | 1            | Bitcoin mining is the process of using computer hardware to do mathematical calculations for the Bitcoin network in order to confirm transactions. Miners collect transaction fees for the transactions they confirm and are awarded bitcoins for each block they verify. As part of bitcoin mining, mining “pools” are a network of miners that work together to mine a block, then split the block reward among the pool miners.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| 54       | 1            | An ERC20 token is a blockchain-based asset with similar functionality to bitcoin, ether, and bitcoin cash: it can hold value and be sent and received. The major difference between ERC20 tokens and other cryptocurrencies is that ERC20 tokens are created and hosted on the Ethereum blockchain, whereas bitcoin and bitcoin cash are the native currencies of their respective blockchains. ERC20 tokens are stored and sent using ethereum addresses and transactions, and use gas to cover transaction fees. ERC20 is an official protocol for proposing improvements to the Ethereum (ETH) network. ERC stands for Ethereum Request for Comment, and 20 is the proposal identifier. This is a common standard for creating tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| 74       | 2            | Each block that is added to the blockchain, starting with the block containing a given transaction, is called a confirmation of that transaction. Ideally, merchants and services that receive payment in the cryptocurrency should wait for at least one confirmation to be distributed over the network, before assuming that the payment was done. The more confirmations that the merchant waits for, the more difficult it is for an attacker to successfully reverse the transaction in a blockchain—unless the attacker controls more than half the total network power, in which case it is called a 51% attack. \[24\]

Within the Bitcoin community there are groups working together in mining pools. \[25\] Some miners use application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) for PoW. \[26\] This trend toward mining pools and specialized ASICs has made mining some cryptocurrencies economically infeasible for most players without access to the latest ASICs, nearby sources of inexpensive energy, or other special advantages. |
| 75       | 1            | Ethereum is a distributed public blockchain network that focuses on running the programming code of any decentralized application. More simply, it is a platform for sharing information across the globe that cannot be manipulated or changed. How is it different than bitcoin? Bitcoin was a pioneer in the blockchain revolution by establishing a public, permissionless, distributed ledger system to validate, store, and replicate transaction data on computers all over the world. Ethereum expands these concepts by harnessing that same block chain capability for computer code. While Bitcoin offers one particular application of block chain technology, a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, Ethereum allows for scripts of code to be run as a global computational network. This concept has a wide range of potential applications such as voting, global supply chains, medical records, the financial system -- the opportunities are endless.

| 94       | 2            | The decentralized nature of P2P networks increases robustness because it removes the single point of failure that can be inherent in a client–server based system. \[41\] As nodes arrive and demand on the system increases, the total capacity of the system also increases, and the likelihood of failure decreases. If one peer on the network fails to function properly, the whole network is not compromised or damaged. In contrast, in a typical client–server architecture, clients share only their demands with the system, but not their resources.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| 2        | 2            | a cryptocurrency is a system that meets six conditions:\[19\]

The system does not require a central authority; its state is maintained through distributed consensus. The system keeps an overview of cryptocurrency units and their ownership. The system defines whether new cryptocurrency units can be created. If new cryptocurrency units can be created, the system defines the circumstances of their origin and how to determine the ownership of these new units. Ownership of cryptocurrency units can be proved exclusively cryptographically.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| 19       | 1            | Ethereum is a distributed public blockchain network that focuses on running the programming code of any decentralized application. More simply, it is a platform for sharing information across the globe that cannot be manipulated or changed. How is it different than bitcoin? Bitcoin was a pioneer in the blockchain revolution by establishing a public, permissionless, distributed ledger system to validate, store, and replicate transaction data on computers all over the world. Ethereum expands these concepts by harnessing that same block chain capability for computer code. While Bitcoin offers one particular application of block chain technology, a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, Ethereum allows for scripts of code to be run as a global computational network. This concept has a wide range of potential applications such as voting, global supply chains, medical records, the financial system -- the opportunities are endless.                                                                                                                                                                      |

Anyone with an Internet connection can send transactions to it as well as become a validator (i.e., participate in the execution of a consensus protocol).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

More simply, it is a platform for sharing information across the globe that cannot be manipulated or changed. How is it different than bitcoin? Bitcoin was a pioneer in the blockchain revolution by establishing a public, permissionless, distributed ledger system to validate, store, and replicate transaction data on computers all over the world.

| 47       | 1            | Cryptocurrencies use various timestamping schemes to "prove" the validity of transactions added to the blockchain ledger without the need for a trusted third party. The first timestamping scheme invented was the proof-of-work scheme. The most widely used proof-of-work schemes are based on SHA-256 and scrypt. \[16\]

Some other hashing algorithms that are used for proof-of-work include CryptoNight, Blake, SHA-3, and X11. The proof-of-stake is a method of securing a cryptocurrency network and achieving distributed consensus through requesting users to show ownership of a certain amount of currency.

| 54       | 1            | An ERC20 token is a blockchain-based asset with similar functionality to bitcoin, ether, and bitcoin cash: it can hold value and be sent and received. The major difference between ERC20 tokens and other cryptocurrencies is that ERC20 tokens are created and hosted on the Ethereum blockchain, whereas bitcoin and bitcoin cash are the native currencies of their respective blockchains. ERC20 tokens are stored and sent using ethereum addresses and transactions, and use gas to cover transaction fees. ERC20 is an official protocol for proposing improvements to the Ethereum (ETH) network. ERC stands for Ethereum Request for Comment, and 20 is the proposal identifier. This is a common standard for creating tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| 57       | 3            | When Bitcoin Cash (BCH) was created, it shared the same address format as bitcoin. In an effort to alleviate any confusion for users of both digital currencies, BCH developers later proposed a new unique format for BCH addresses called CashAddr. This new address format will help users more easily distinguish between bitcoin and BCH addresses. The updated format only changes how BCH addresses are displayed, not the underlying private and public keys.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| 60       | 1            | Bitcoin is pseudonymous rather than anonymous in that the cryptocurrency within a wallet is not tied to people, but rather to one or more specific keys (or "addresses"). \[57\] Thereby, bitcoin owners are not identifiable, but all transactions are publicly available in the blockchain. Still, cryptocurrency exchanges are often required by law to collect the personal information of their users. \[citation needed\]

Additions such as Monero, Zerocoin, Zerocash and CryptoNote have been suggested, which would allow for additional anonymity and fungibility. \[58\]\[59\]

| 69       | 2            | A blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks, that are linked together using cryptography. \[1\]\[2\]\[3\]\[4\] Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree). The timestamp proves that the transaction data existed when the block was published in order to get into its hash. As blocks each contain information about the block previous to it, they form a chain, with each additional block reinforcing the ones before it. Therefore, blockchains are resistant to modification of their data because once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks. Blockchains are typically managed by a peer-to-peer network for use as a publicly distributed ledger, where nodes collectively adhere to a protocol to communicate and validate new blocks. Although blockchain records are not unalterable as forks are possible, blockchains may be considered secure by design and exemplify a distributed computing system with high Byzantine fault tolerance. |

| 87       | 3            | In 1983, the American cryptographer David Chaum conceived an anonymous cryptographic electronic money called ecash. \[7\]\[8\] Later, in 1995, he implemented it through Digicash,\[9\] an early form of cryptographic electronic payments which required user software in order to withdraw notes from a bank and designate specific encrypted keys before it can be sent to a recipient. This allowed the digital currency to be untraceable by the issuing bank, the government, or any third party.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
