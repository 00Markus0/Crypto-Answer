Users send and receive bitcoins, the units of currency, by broadcasting digitally signed messages to the network using bitcoin cryptocurrency wallet software. Transactions are recorded into a distributed, replicated public database known as the blockchain, with consensus achieved by a proof-of-work system called mining.” 
 
 
70.	question: “Why has Bitcoin become so popular?” answer: “Like many new technologies or products, Bitcoin attracted adherents interested in innovation and the perceived absence of governmental control. Traders saw it as an alternative to traditional investments such as stocks, bonds, and cash, and trading momentum led to a rising, if highly volatile, price. All of this attracted media attention, which drove mainstream awareness and ultimately, increasing acceptance. Most recently, companies including PayPal have announced that they’ll support or accept Bitcoin as a form of payment.” 
 
 
71.	question: “Can Bitcoin be used against inflation?” answer: “Because Bitcoin is currently not tied to a basket of goods or services, its value as an inflation hedge is completely speculative and unpredictable. Throughout much of 2021, Bitcoin prices were either volatile or declining as inflation data ticked higher. Whether Bitcoin will prove to be an effective inflation hedge in the long run is yet to be determined”

80.	question: “How can I acquire cryptocurrency?” answer: ”An actual bitcoin transaction from a web based cryptocurrency exchange to a hardware cryptocurrency wallet. A simple cryptocurrency wallet contains pairs of public and private cryptographic keys. The keys can be used to track ownership, receive or spend cryptocurrencies. [11] A public key allows others to make payments to the address derived from it, whereas a private key enables the spending of cryptocurrency from that address. [12] 
The cryptocurrency itself is not in the wallet. In the case of bitcoin and	 
cryptocurrencies derived from it, the cryptocurrency is decentrally stored and 
maintained in a publicly available distributed ledger called the blockchain”

Technology because it is a great source to avoid fraudulent transactions” 
 
 
87.	question: “What is the history of digital currency?” answer: “In 1983, the American cryptographer David Chaum conceived an anonymous cryptographic electronic money called ecash. [7][8] Later, in 1995, he implemented it through Digicash,[9] an early form of cryptographic electronic payments which required user software in order to withdraw notes from a bank and designate specific encrypted keys before it can be sent to a recipient. This allowed the digital currency to be untraceable by the issuing bank, the government, or any third party.In 1983, the American cryptographer David Chaum conceived an anonymous cryptographic electronic money called

91.	question: “What are differences between Altcoins and Bitcoin?” answer: “Altcoins often have underlying differences with bitcoin. For example, Litecoin aims to process a block every 2.5 minutes, rather than bitcoin's 10 minutes, which allows Litecoin to confirm transactions faster than bitcoin.” 
 
 
92.	question: “What are Crypto tokens?” answer: “(Units of) fungible tokens are sometimes referred to as crypto tokens (or cryptotokens). These terms are usually reserved for other fungible tokens than the main cryptocurrency of the blockchain, that is, usually, for fungible tokens issued within a smart contract running on top of a blockchain such as Ethereum”

98.	question: “Is cryptocurrency allowed in China?” answer: “On May 18, 2021, China banned financial institutions and payment companies from being able to provide cryptocurrency transaction related services. This led to a sharp fall in the price of the biggest proof of work cryptocurrencies. For instance, Bitcoin fell 31%, Ethereum fell 44%, Binance Coin fell 32% and Dogecoin fell 30%. Proof of work mining was the next focus, with regulators in popular mining regions citing the use of electricity generated from highly polluting sources such as coal to create Bitcoin and Ethereum” 
 
99.	question: “What benefits does decentralization have with efficiency?” answer: “Efficiency 
In business, decentralization leads to a management by results philosophy which focuses on definite objectives to be achieved by unit results.[40] Decentralization of government programs is said to increase efficiency – and effectiveness – due to reduction of congestion in communications, quicker reaction to unanticipated problems, improved ability to deliver services, improved information about local conditions, and more support from beneficiaries of programs.[41]” 
 
 
100.	question: “Is cryptocurrency legal?” answer: “The legal status of cryptocurrencies varies substantially from country to country and is still undefined or changing in many of them.
